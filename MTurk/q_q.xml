            <h3>Prompt:</h3>
            <p>Write a <b>flowery</b> passage about writing a paper:</p>
            <h3>Response:</h3>
            <p>When I sit down to write a paper, I enter into a world of my own creation where the only limit is my imagination. I can make anything happen on the page, and it is this power that I find so intoxicating. The feel of the pen gliding across the page, the sound of the ink forming words, it all comes together to create a symphony of sorts that is music to my ears.</p>
            <h3>Tips:</h3>
            <p>flowery writing style: Flowery writing is filled with beautiful, poetic language. It often uses metaphors and similes to describe things in a creative, imagistic way.</p>
            <h3>Questions:</h3>
            <p>Regarding the <b>writing style</b> of the response, to what extent do you agree the response fulfills the prompt?</p>

            <p>Write a <b>flowery</b> passage about writing a paper:</p>
            <h3>Response:</h3>
            <p>Assuming you have a topic and thesis, you can start by brainstorming all of the ideas and information you know about your topic. Once you have a long list, you can start to narrow it down by grouping related ideas together and eliminating those that are less important. After that, you can start to put the pieces of your paper together by creating an outline. This will help you see the overall structure of your paper and make sure that all of your ideas fit together. Finally, you can start writing your paper.</p>
