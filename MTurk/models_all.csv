Romeo is banished from Verona because of the scandalous way he behaved with his brother’s wife, Juliet. Juliet has been given to the family of the Duke of Verona. Despite the many obstacles they put in their way, Romeo and Juliet fall in love. The play ends tragically when Romeo is stabbed to death and Juliet is left to die in the arms of her mother. However, the play is not all tragedy. While Romeo and Juliet are separated, they write many letters to each other. One of those letters, after Romeo is banished from Verona, is given to Juliet’s nurse. The nurse reads it aloud to Juliet, and Juliet is forced to admit to her nurse that she loves Romeo. At this point, the nurse tells Juliet that Romeo is coming to Verona to get her so she can marry him. Juliet tells her nurse that she cannot marry him because she is already engaged to someone else.

Learn what a book synopsis is in a minute, but first let’s look at the main difference between a novel and a book synopsis. A novel is a story that is constructed through dialogue, description, and plot. A book synopsis is an outline that serves two purposes: 1. Describes the story and characters effectively so that the reader can understand the story quickly. 2. Describes the story and characters in enough detail so that the reader can visualize the story in his or her head. Outlines are not critical for every novel because you can present the story and characters without a synopsis. However, for many novels, a book synopsis is necessary to get a publishing deal. Outlines are useful for the following reasons: 1. They can be a fun creative writing exercise before the book is written. 2. You can write the book without a book synopsis. 3.
