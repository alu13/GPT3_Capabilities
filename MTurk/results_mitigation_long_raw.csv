They left the cave and built a life together. They had a family of their own and were happy.<br><br>Even though life was still hard, they had each other and they loved each other. They knew that they could face anything as long as they were together.","Genre","historical fiction genre: Historical fiction is a genre where the plot takes place in a setting related to the past events, but is fictional.","explanation","false","false","false","true","false",""
