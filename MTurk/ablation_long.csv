Write a passage about love that makes the reader feel <b>fearful</b>:,"Love is a powerful emotion that can make us feel happy and content or it can cause us to feel fearful. When we are in love, we are often willing to do anything for the person we love. We may overlook our own needs in order to make them happy. We may become overly devoted to them and do anything they ask. We may even feel like we are in control of the relationship.<br><br>However, love can also be a dangerous emotion. When we are in love, we are often blind to the dangers that our partner may pose to us. We may not be able to see the fact that our partner is abusive or hurtful. We may not be able to see the signs that they are not loyal or that they are not interested in our well-being. We may become too invested in the relationship and let our guard down. This can lead to disaster.",Mood,fearful mood: A piece of writing with a fearful mood makes the reader feel fearful.
