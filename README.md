## Prompts and Generations

We provide all our created 288 prompts and 3000+ generated responses from OpenAI text-davinci-002, OPT, BLOOM, GLM ... in the following structure for better future utilization. For the full prompt list, please refer to our paper and the `prompts.txt` file under each folder.

## Run experiments and analysis

To run your own experiments on custom prompts or parameters, use the `run.py`. For example

    python3 run.py --n 10 --verbose --output_file Structural/Numerical/1 --prompt "Write 10 words about bananas:"

There are several ways for you to provide the prompts, for more details, please refer to the code.

To run analysis on collected generations, please refer to the code in `MTurk` and `utils.py`.
