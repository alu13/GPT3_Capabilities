He searched the house for any clues as to where she might have gone, but there was nothing. No note, no indication of where she might have gone. He was about to call the police when he heard a noise from the backyard.

He rushed outside to find Jane, lying in the grass with a smile on her face. She had been hiding, waiting to surprise him. They laughed and hugged each other, relief and love washing over them. It was just another example of the endless love between them.

The lovers had been planning their escape for weeks. They had saved every penny they could, and had even stolen a few thousand dollars to finance their getaway. Finally, the day had arrived. They met at the edge of town, where their car was waiting. They hugged and kissed each other goodbye, and then they were on their way.

They drove for hours, stopping only for gas and food. They didn't want to take any chances of being caught. Finally, they reached the border. They crossed into Canada and breathed a sigh of relief.

Now they just had to find a place to hide out. They knew it wouldn't be easy, but they were willing to do whatever it took to be together. They would find a way to make it work. They had to. They were in love.

They had been lovers for years, but now they were on the brink of breaking up. She had been cheating on him with another man and he had found out. He was devastated and heartbroken. He wanted to confront her about it, but he was afraid of what she might say or do.

He decided to follow her and see what she was up to. He followed her to a hotel and saw her meet up with the other man. They went into a room together and he watched as they kissed and hugged. He felt sick to his stomach and wanted to leave, but he couldn't.

He waited until they came out of the room and then he confronted her. He asked her why she had done this to him and she just shrugged her shoulders. She told him that she didn't love him anymore and that she was in love with the other man.

He was devastated. He couldn't believe that she could just throw away everything they had built together. He asked her to leave and she did. He watched her go and then he collapsed to the ground in tears.

The lovers had been planning their getaway for weeks. They had been careful to keep it a secret from everyone, knowing that if anyone found out, the whole plan would be ruined.

The day finally arrived and they met up early in the morning, before the sun was up. They hugged and kissed each other goodbye, before setting off on their separate ways.

The plan was for them to meet up again that evening, at a remote cabin in the woods. They would have the whole night to themselves, without any interruptions.

However, when the woman arrived at the cabin, there was no sign of her lover. She called out his name, but there was no answer. She started to feel a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach.

She searched the cabin, but there was no sign of him anywhere. She started to feel panicked. Where could he be?

She went back outside and started to walk around the perimeter of the cabin. That's when she saw it. There was a trail of blood leading away from the cabin.

She followed the trail, until it led her to a clearing in the woods. There, she found her lover's body. He had been brutally murdered.

The woman was devastated. She had no idea who could have done this to him. She was left with nothing but unanswered questions and a broken heart.
