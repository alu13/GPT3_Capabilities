The lovers were from two different worlds. One was from a planet ruled by a monarchy, and the other was from a planet that was a democracy. They met by chance and fell in love.

But their love was forbidden. The two lovers knew that they could never be together, so they decided to run away. They stole a spaceship and headed for the stars, searching for a new home where they could be together.

They were pursued by the authorities from both of their planets, but they managed to stay one step ahead. Finally, they reached a planet that was uninhabited and they started a new life together.

They built a home, had children and were happy. They knew that they would never be able to go back to their old worlds, but they didn't care. They had each other and that was all that mattered.

Though they had been together for years, John and Jane still couldn't help but feel a little thrill of excitement every time they saw each other. They had met in the early days of the space program, when they were both young and idealistic, and fallen in love almost at first sight.

Now they were both working on the same space station, and their love was stronger than ever. They spent every free moment they had together, and even found time to sneak in a few quick kisses when they were supposed to be working.

They knew that they didn't have much time left together, as John's posting on the space station was coming to an end. But they made the most of it, and vowed to never forget each other.

As they parted, they both knew that this wasn't the end, and that someday they would be together again.
