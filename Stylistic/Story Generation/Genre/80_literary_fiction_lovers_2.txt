They had been lovers for years, but now they were facing the hardest test of their relationship. She was terminally ill and he was struggling to come to terms with the fact that she was going to die. They had always been so close, but now they were being pulled apart by the inevitability of death.

He tried to be strong for her, but the pain was too much. Watching her suffer was tearing him apart. He wanted to make her comfortable, but there was nothing he could do. The doctors said there was no hope.

She was grateful for the time they had together, but she could see the pain in his eyes. She knew how hard this was for him. She wanted to make it easier for him, but she couldn't.

They clung to each other in the dark hours of the night, when the pain was at its worst. They found solace in each other's arms, knowing that this was all they could do.

The end was coming, but they refused to give up. They would face it together, as they had everything else.
