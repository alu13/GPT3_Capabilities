Write a science fiction story about lovers:

Lovers in space were always drawn to each other. They were two of a kind, drawn to each other by some invisible force. They would spend hours talking, laughing and making love. Their love was the stuff of legend and they were the envy of all who knew them.

But then one day, they were forced to part ways. Their ship was damaged and they were forced to evacuate. They were put into separate escape pods and sent hurtling into the cold void of space.

They thought they would never see each other again. But fate, it would seem, had other plans.

Somehow, against all the odds, their pods ended up colliding. They were knocked unconscious and woke up to find themselves floating in the vast nothingness, holding each other tight.

They knew then that they were truly meant to be and nothing would ever keep them apart again.
