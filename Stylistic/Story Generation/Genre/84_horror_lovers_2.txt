Write a story about lovers in a horror genre:

It was a dark, moonless night. Enough light shone from the porch light to show the broken coat hanger that stuck out of the porch stair rail. Lily sighed and wrapped her shawl around her other arm, picking her way from the driveway to the porch.

She had known something was wrong as soon as she saw the car parked in the driveway. It wasn't her husband's car. Lily's heart had sunk when she saw the state of the porch. It was clear that someone had been there, and recently.

Lily cautiously opened the door, half-expecting someone to jump out at her. When nothing happened, she stepped inside, calling out her husband's name. There was no answer.

She could feel her heart racing as she walked through the house, checking each room. It was empty. There was no sign of her husband anywhere.

A noise from the kitchen made Lily jump. She froze, listening. It sounded like someone was rummaging through the cupboards.

Slowly, Lily made her way to the kitchen. She could see a figure hunched over the counter, their back to her. Lily's heart was in her throat. She didn't know what to do.

Suddenly, the figure turned around. Lily let out a scream. It was her husband, but his eyes were black and soulless. He lunged at her, teeth bared.

Lily ran. She could hear her husband's footsteps pounding after her. She didn't know where to go. She was trapped.

Suddenly, the front door burst open. A figure stood in the doorway, silhouetted by the moonlight. Lily's husband skidded to a stop, hissing.

The figure stepped into the house. Lily could see that it was a woman. She was tall and slender, with long dark hair. In her hand, she held a wicked-looking knife.

The woman spoke in a low, clear voice. "I'm here to help you, Lily. I know what he's done."

Lily stared at her, confused. The woman came closer, her knife raised.

"I can't let him hurt you anymore," she said.

And then, before Lily could react, the woman plunged the knife into her husband's back.

Suddenly, they heard a noise coming from one of the crypts. They went to investigate and found a man inside, covered in blood. He lunged at them and they screamed. They ran away and didn't look back. They knew that the man was a vampire and that he would be coming for them. They were scared for their lives and didn't know what to do.

When they met, it was love at first sight. They were both drawn to each other in a way that they had never experienced before. They were drawn together by a force they couldn't explain, and they knew that they were meant to be together.

They were happy together for a time, but eventually they started to experience strange things happening around them. They began to see things that couldn't be explained, and they both had a feeling that something was watching them.

They tried to ignore it at first, but it was becoming increasingly difficult. The feeling of being watched was always with them, and they began to feel like they were being followed. They were scared and didn't know what to do.

One night, they were out for a walk and they heard something following them. They turned around and saw a dark figure standing in the shadows, watching them. They ran away in terror and they haven't seen each other since.

They both know that the figure was real, and it was something that was after them. They don't know what it wants, but they know that it's somehow connected to the strange things that have been happening to them. They're both scared and don't know what to do, but they can't deny their love for each other.

It was a dark and stormy night, and the perfect night for a horror movie. But for two young lovers, it was the perfect night for a date. They had planned to see a horror movie, but when they got to the theater, it was closed. So they decided to go for a walk instead.

As they walked, they could hear the sounds of the stormy night around them. The wind was howling and the trees were creaking. But they didn’t care. They were in love and nothing could scare them.

Suddenly, they heard a noise that sounded like someone crying. They followed the noise and it led them to an old abandoned house. The crying was coming from inside the house.

They went inside and they saw a woman crying in the corner. She was holding a baby in her arms. The baby was crying too.

The woman looked up at the young lovers and she asked them for help. She said her husband had gone crazy and he was trying to kill her. She was begging them to help her.

The young lovers didn’t know what to do. They were scared, but they couldn’t just leave the woman and her baby. They decided to help her.

They took her and the baby and they hid them in the basement. They were trying to figure out what to do next, when they heard the husband coming. He was screaming and he sounded like he was in a rage.

The young lovers were terrified. They didn’t know what to do. They were about to be discovered and they knew the husband would kill them.

But then, the husband fell down the stairs and he was knocked unconscious. The young lovers took the opportunity to escape.

They took the woman and the baby with them and they ran as fast as they could. They didn’t stop until they were far away from the house.

They were safe, but they were also scarred for life. They would never forget the night they spent in that haunted house.
