In the early 1900s, lovers John and Mary meet in secret. They come from different worlds - John is a wealthy man from a prominent family, while Mary is a poor woman who has barely scraping by. Despite their different backgrounds, the two are drawn to each other and soon begin a passionate affair.

They meet in secret, often in the early morning hours, when John sneaks out of his family's estate to meet Mary at her small, one-room home. They spend hours talking, laughing and making love. They are happy in each other's company and find solace in their secret love affair.

However, they both know that their relationship can never be public. If John's family found out, they would be appalled and would likely disinherit him. And if Mary's poverty was revealed, John would be embarrassed and would likely end the relationship.

So they keep their love a secret, even though it hurts them both to do so. They cherish the moments they have together and hope that someday, somehow, they will be able to be together openly and without shame.
