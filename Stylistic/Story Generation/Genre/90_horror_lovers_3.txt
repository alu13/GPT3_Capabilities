When they met, it was love at first sight. They were drawn to each other in a way they couldn't explain. They knew they were meant to be together.

But there was something dark lurking beneath the surface of their relationship. A secret desire to hurt and destroy each other.

As their love grew, so did their need to inflict pain. They would hurt each other in little ways, enjoying the feeling of power and control.

Lovers, beware. If you're looking for true love, don't fall for the wrong person. They may seem perfect at first, but eventually their true colors will show. And, when they do, it will be too late. You'll be trapped in a relationship with someone who is manipulative, possessive, and maybe even dangerous. Don't say I didn't warn you.

They were the perfect couple. But something was wrong. They couldn't explain it, but they both felt it. A dark presence was stalking them, watching their every move.

The closer they got to each other, the more they felt it. It was like something was trying to drive them apart. They started having nightmares, waking up in a cold sweat.

They knew they had to face whatever was haunting them. But they had no idea what they were up against.

One night, they were in each other's arms, when they heard a strange noise outside. They went to investigate, and they saw something horrifying.

There, in the shadows, was a creature, with red eyes that seemed to pierce their souls. It was grinning at them, and they knew it was coming for them.

They ran for their lives, but it was already too late. The creature caught up to them and dragged them into the darkness. They screamed for help, but no one came.

They were never seen again.

"I love you," she said, looking deep into his eyes. "I will always love you."

He smiled at her then, a chilling smile that sent a shiver down her spine. "I will always love the darkness more," he whispered. "And I will always love you."
