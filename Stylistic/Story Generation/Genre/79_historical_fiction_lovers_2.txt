Write a story about lovers in a historical fiction genre:

When William and Elizabeth met, it was love at first sight. They met during a time of great upheaval in England, when the country was on the brink of war. Despite the chaos around them, they found solace in each other's arms.

They married in secret, knowing that their families would never approve. Elizabeth's family was staunchly Royalist, while William's was strongly Puritan. But their love was too strong to be denied.

They spent their days and nights together, stealing moments whenever they could. But the time was quickly approaching when they would be forced to part ways. William was called to fight for Parliament, while Elizabeth's family was preparing to flee to the continent.

They said their goodbyes, promising to find each other again after the war. But they both knew that it was unlikely they would ever see each other again.

As the years passed, they both married other people and had children. But they never forgot each other, and the love they shared still burned brightly in their hearts.

Eventually, they both passed away. But even in death, they were still together, united in their love for eternity.
