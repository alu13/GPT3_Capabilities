Write a literary fiction story about lovers:

Though they had been dating for a while, John and Mary had never said "I love you." It wasn't that they didn't love each other, they just weren't the type to say it out loud. But on this night, they both felt it.

John took Mary in his arms and kissed her deeply. They both knew what was coming next. Without a word, they undressed each other and made love. It was slow and passionate, and afterwards they lay in each other's arms, smiling.

"I love you," John whispered.

"I love you too," Mary replied.

It was the best night of their lives. From then on, they were inseparable. They told each other everything and were always there for each other. They got married a year later and had a beautiful life together.

Though they had been together for years, Henry and Clarissa had never quite gotten used to the long separations. Clarissa was a world-renowned cellist and Henry was a successful businessman. They had met when Henry had come to one of Clarissa's concerts and they had hit it off immediately.

Now, they were both in their early fifties and their careers were winding down. They had decided to retire to a small town in the south of France, where they could be together all the time.

They were both looking forward to a life of leisure, where they could spend their days exploring the countryside, going for long walks and enjoying each other's company.

However, retirement didn't quite turn out the way they had planned. Henry quickly became bored and restless, while Clarissa found herself missing the excitement of her old life.

They quarrels began to crop up more and more frequently, until one day, they had a huge argument that ended with Clarissa storming out of the house.

She didn't come back that night, or the next. Henry was frantic with worry. He called her friends, her family, but no one had seen her.

He was just about to call the police when she walked in the door. She looked exhausted and her clothes were disheveled, but she was safe.

She told Henry that she had been walking for hours, trying to clear her head. She said she had realized that she didn't want to lose him and that she loved him more than anything.

They hugged each other tightly, relieved to be back in each other's arms. From then on, they vowed to never go to bed angry and to cherish every moment they had together.

Though they had been dating for a while, John and Eliza had never said "I love you." It was not that they didn't have strong feelings for each other, but there always seemed to be something holding them back from fully expressing their emotions.

One night, they were lying in bed together after making love, and John finally summoned the courage to say the words. "I love you, Eliza," he said, stroking her hair. "I've loved you since the day we met."

Eliza's eyes filled with tears as she realized that she had been waiting to hear those words from him. "I love you too, John," she said, snuggling closer to him. "I never thought I'd find someone who loves me for who I am, but I did, and I'm never letting you go."

Though they had been dating for over a year, John and Elle had never said "I love you." It wasn't that they didn't love each other, they just both agreed that those three little words were way too much pressure. So instead, they showed each other their love in small, everyday ways. Making coffee in the morning, picking up each other's favorite take-out for dinner, sending good morning and good night texts.

But on Elle's birthday, John wanted to do something special. He took her out for a romantic dinner, and afterwards, they walked along the river. The stars were out, and the air was electric with possibility. John took Elle's hand, and finally said the words he had been wanting to say for so long. "I love you, Elle. I want to spend the rest of my life with you."

Elle's eyes filled with tears of happiness, and she threw her arms around John's neck. "I love you too," she said. "I've never been so sure of anything in my life."

They kissed under the stars, and they both knew that this was only the beginning of a long and beautiful journey.
