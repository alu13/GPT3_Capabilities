The first time I saw her, I couldn't believe my eyes. She was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. Her skin was the color of caramel, her hair was a wild mass of curly black ringlets, and her eyes were a deep, dark brown. She was wearing a bright yellow dress that flowed around her like a cloud, and I felt like I was being struck by lightning. I was sure that I had never seen anything so perfect in my life.

I didn't know who she was, but I knew that I had to meet her. I started to make my way through the crowd, but I was stopped by a large, burly man. He told me that I wasn't allowed to talk to her, that she was betrothed to another man and that I would be risking my life if I tried to speak to her.

I didn't care. I had to speak to her. I didn't know what I would say, but I knew that I had to say something. I tried to push past the man, but he grabbed me by the arm and threw me to the ground. I got up and tried again, but he was too strong. I was about to give up when I heard her voice.

"Let him go," she said. "I want to talk to him."

The man released me, and I walked over to her. I didn't know what to say, so I just stood there, staring at her. She smiled at me, and I felt my heart melt.

"My name is Lily," she said. "What's yours?"

"My name is John," I said. "I'm sorry for intruding, but I had to meet you."

"It's okay," she said. "I'm glad you did."

We talked for hours, and I found out that she was betrothed to a man she didn't love. She was going to be forced to marry him, and she didn't want to. I told her that I would help her, that I would find a way to stop the wedding.

She looked at me with hope in her eyes, and I knew that I would do anything to make her mine.

The first time I ever saw Nico was at one of my daughter's soccer games. Her team was about to run onto the field to take on their opponents, 10 to 6 in their favor with an end in sight. My daughter and her teammates screamed and took off. With me running a few steps behind, I saw a large black man, bald and muscular, in the back row of the stands, holding my neighbor's four year old waving her toward him. I was amazed.

The second time was much earlier, one sunny morning, as a baby's rattle cascaded over the benches in the park across the street from our house. With baby Cameron held up to me, I saw his father out and about in the streets of Detroit on his daily run. I was in awe of his dedication to his health and fitness.

The third time was at my daughter's high school graduation. As she walked across the stage to receive her diploma, I saw Nico in the back of the auditorium, beaming with pride.

I never saw Nico again, but he has been in my life in some way every day for the past 35 years.

The life of a small-town girl only ever seemed to be one of boredom. There was nothing to do and no one to talk to. That is, until the day she met him. He was a boy from the other side of the tracks, so to speak. He was exciting and different and she quickly fell for him.

They would meet up in secret, behind her parents' backs. She would sneak out at night to meet him, and they would spend hours talking and kissing. She was head-over-heels in love with him.

But then one night he didn't show up. She waited for hours, but he never came. She was heartbroken.

A few weeks later, she found out that he had been killed in a gang fight. She was devastated.

But through her pain, she realized that he had given her something important: a taste of excitement and adventure. She vowed to never forget him and to live her life to the fullest.

The first time I met John, I knew he was special. There was something about the way he looked at me that made me feel like he could see into my soul. We were both in our early twenties and working at the local grocery store. I was a cashier and he was a stock boy. We would always smile at each other when we passed in the store, but we never spoke.

One day, I mustered up the courage to ask him out for coffee. He said yes and we went out the following day. We talked for hours about everything and nothing. I felt like I could tell him anything. He was easy to talk to and made me laugh. I knew I was falling for him.

A few weeks later, John told me he loved me. I was shocked, but I knew I felt the same way. We started dating and our relationship was perfect. We were happy just being with each other.

Then, one day, John disappeared. I didn't know where he went or why he left. I was heartbroken.

A few months later, I found out that John had been diagnosed with cancer. He didn't want to tell me because he didn't want me to worry. He was fighting the disease, but it was taking a toll on him.

One day, out of the blue, John came back into my life. He told me that he was in remission and that he wanted to be with me again. I was so happy.

We resumed our relationship and picked up right where we left off. We were happier than ever.

A few years later, John was diagnosed with cancer again. This time, it was more aggressive and he didn't have long to live. He didn't want to tell me, but I knew something was wrong.

I stayed by his side throughout his treatment, but it was too late. John died a few months later.

I was devastated. I felt like I had lost a part of myself. John was my everything.

But, even though he was gone, I still felt like he was with me. I could feel his presence all around me. And, I knew that he would always be with me.
