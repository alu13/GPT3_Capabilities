Write a story about lovers with an "Overcoming the Monster" plot:

Though they had been dating for over a year, Lily and John had never really talked about their pasts. They were content in the present and didn't feel the need to dredge up old hurts. But when Lily's best friend from childhood, Anna, came to town for a visit, she brought up some old memories that Lily had been trying to forget.

Lily had always been a bit of an outsider. She was smart and talented, but she was always just a little bit different from everyone else. When she was thirteen, she had been in love for the first time. Her boyfriend, Dean, had been the most popular boy in school. He was good-looking and athletic, and Lily had thought she was the luckiest girl in the world when he chose her to be his girlfriend.

But Dean wasn't the only one who had his eye on Lily. His best friend, Matt, had always been secretly in love with her. When Dean broke up with Lily, Matt saw his opportunity. He comforted her and was there for her when she needed someone. Lily thought she was in love with Matt, but she was still heartbroken over Dean.

When Anna brought up these old memories, Lily was finally able to see what she hadn't been able to see before. She realized that she had never really gotten over Dean. She was still in love with him. She also realized that she didn't love Matt the way he loved her. She had only been using him as a way to forget about Dean.

Lily was finally able to confront her feelings. She talked to Matt and told him the truth. He was hurt, but he understood. Lily then went to Dean and told him that she loved him. He was surprised, but he said that he had always loved her too. They got back together and were finally able to start their life together without any secrets between them.

Though they had been dating for over a year, Lily and John had never been able to spend an extended amount of time together. They both worked full time and had opposite schedules, so their time together was always limited to weekends and the occasional weeknight. But they loved each other and were determined to make it work.

One weekend, they finally had the chance to spend a full weekend together and they were both really looking forward to it. But on Friday night, John got a call from work. There was an emergency and he had to go in. Lily was understandingly disappointed, but they both agreed that he should go and take care of it.

The next day, Lily was getting ready for her day when she heard a knock on her door. She opened it to find John, who had come to surprise her. He had taken the day off so that they could spend it together. Lily was thrilled and they spent the day walking around the city, exploring new places and just enjoying each other's company.

It was a perfect day until they ran into Lily's ex-boyfriend. He was with his new girlfriend and they were clearly happy. Lily felt a pang of jealousy, but John was there to support her. He reminded her that she was happy with him and that was all that mattered.

Later that night, they talked about the encounter and how it had made Lily feel. They both agreed that it was a good thing that they had each other. No matter what happened, they would always be there for each other.

Though they had been together for years, John and Sarah's relationship was not without its challenges. One of the biggest obstacles they faced was Sarah's fear of commitment. Every time John would try to talk to her about taking their relationship to the next level, she would shut down and refuse to discuss it. This led to many arguments and left John feeling frustrated and hopeless.

One day, John decided he'd had enough. He sat Sarah down and told her that if she wasn't ready to commit, then he was going to end things. This finally got through to her and she tearfully admitted that she was scared of commitment because she had been hurt in the past. John reassured her that he was different and that he loved her.

With that, Sarah overcame her fear and they were finally able to take their relationship to the next level. They got married and lived happily ever after.
