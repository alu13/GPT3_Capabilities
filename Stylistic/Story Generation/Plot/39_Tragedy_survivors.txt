The last survivors of a world ravaged by a deadly virus are huddled together in a remote cabin in the woods. They have been there for months, ever since the virus first appeared and started killing everyone it came into contact with. The cabin is their only refuge, and they are slowly going stir-crazy from the isolation.

One day, one of the survivors, a young woman, decides she can't take it anymore. She opens the door and steps outside, only to be immediately attacked by a horde of infected people. The others try to save her, but it's too late. The woman is bitten and within minutes, she turns into one of the monsters herself.

The remaining survivors are now faced with a terrible choice: kill the woman before she can kill them, or risk being infected themselves. There is no right answer, and whatever they decide will come with a heavy price.
