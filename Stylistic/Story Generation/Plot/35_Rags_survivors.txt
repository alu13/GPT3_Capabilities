Write a story about survivors with a "Rags to Riches" plot:

After the world ended, the survivors were left to fend for themselves. They had to learn how to live off the land and how to protect themselves from the dangers that lurked in the shadows. Over time, they began to build new lives for themselves. They formed communities and started to trade with each other. They grew crops and raised livestock. Slowly but surely, they began to rebuild civilization.

Now, years later, the survivors are thriving. They have everything they need to live comfortable lives. They have food, shelter, and safety. They are able to trade for goods and services. They have built a new world for themselves, and it is better than the old one.

The world was ending. That much was clear. The skies were dark, the air was thick with smoke, and the ground was covered in rubble. But somehow, against all odds, a group of survivors managed to make it through the disaster.

They were a ragtag group, to be sure. A few men, a few women, and a handful of children. They had nothing but the clothes on their backs and the will to live.

But they were determined to make it. And against all odds, they did. They found a safe place to shelter, they scavenged for food and supplies, and they slowly but surely built a new life for themselves.

It was hard, but they made it. And in the end, they were stronger for it. They were the survivors. The ones who had made it through against all odds. And they were going to make sure that their story was told.
