The world as we know it ended in a cataclysmic event that wiped out most of humanity. But a few lucky survivors managed to make it to a remote island where they've been living for the past year.

Life is tough on the island, but the survivors have managed to make the best of it. They've built shelters, hunted for food, and even made some new friends along the way.

But the one thing they all long for is contact with the outside world. They've been sending out signals for help, but so far there's been no response.

One day, out of the blue, a helicopter appears on the horizon. The survivors are overjoyed and wave it down. But as it gets closer, they realize that the helicopter is filled with zombies!

The survivors quickly realize that they're not the only ones left in the world. They band together and fight off the zombies, vowing to never give up hope.

And even though they know it won't be easy, they're determined to find a way to rebuild their world. Because as long as they stick together, they know they can survive anything.

After the outbreak, a group of survivors find themselves holed up in a small convenience store. They've been there for weeks, ever since the infection first started spreading. They've been rationing the food and supplies, but they're running low. The group is getting desperate.

One day, one of the survivors, a woman named Sarah, comes up with an idea. She suggests that they all dress up in silly costumes and tell jokes to each other to try and lighten the mood. At first, the others are skeptical, but they eventually go along with it.

The plan works, and for a few days the group is able to forget about the horror outside. They laugh and joke and have a good time. But eventually, reality sets in again. They can't stay in the store forever.

The group decides to venture out and see if they can find any other survivors. They're not sure what they'll find, but they know they have to try. Together, they venture out into the new world, searching for a new place to call home.

After the outbreak, a small group of survivors huddled together in a remote cabin in the woods. They were all that was left of humanity. The days were long and filled with monotony, but they made the best of it. They were determined to rebuild civilization.

One day, one of the survivors, a woman named Sarah, went out into the woods to gather firewood. She was gone for hours and the others began to worry. Eventually, she stumbled back into the cabin, covered in blood. The others were shocked and terrified, but Sarah just laughed.

It turns out that Sarah had stumbled upon a group of zombies. She had killed them all with her bare hands and teeth. The others were so relieved and grateful that they couldn't help but laugh. Sarah had saved them all.

From then on, the group was known as the "comedy survivors." They laughed in the face of danger and embraced the absurd. They knew that as long as they had each other, they could get through anything.
