When they met, it was like they had known each other in a previous life. They just clicked and were inseparable from that day forward. They were always drawn to each other, even in a room full of people. It was as if they had a magnetic force between them.

Throughout their relationship, they would often have déjà vu experiences. They would finish each other's sentences and know what the other was thinking without having to say a word. It was like they were connected on a deeper level than anyone else could understand.

When they made love, it was transcendent. They would often spend hours just exploring each other's bodies, getting lost in one another. It was like they were making love for the first time every time.

Eventually, they got married and started a family. They were happy and content, but always had a feeling that there was something more.

One day, they were out for a walk and they saw each other across a busy street. They both froze, realizing that they had died in a car accident in their previous life. This was their chance at a rebirth and they knew that they would be together again in this life and all future lives.
