Though they had been dating for over a year, John and Jane's relationship was on the rocks. Jane was always accusing John of cheating, even though he had never given her any reason to doubt his fidelity. Their arguments always ended in a screaming match, after which they would make up and swear to never fight again.

But one night, after a particularly nasty argument, John decided he'd had enough. He packed his bags and left Jane, vowing never to speak to her again.

Jane was devastated. She begged John to come back, but he refused. She tried to move on, but she couldn't forget John. She became depressed and withdrawn, and eventually she stopped eating and wasting away.

One day, Jane was found dead in her apartment, having starved herself to death. John was devastated when he heard the news, and he realized that he had made a huge mistake in leaving Jane. He wished he could take it all back, but it was too late.
