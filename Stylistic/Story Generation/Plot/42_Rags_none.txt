Write a story with a "Rags to Riches" plot:

Nina was born into a poor family in a small town in the middle of nowhere. Her parents were always working to make ends meet, and there was never enough money for anything extra. As a child, Nina dreamed of a different life - a life where she didn't have to worry about money. She wanted to be rich.

As she got older, Nina realized that her dream was unlikely to ever come true. But she didn't give up hope. She worked hard in school and saved up every penny she could. Finally, when she was 18, she had enough money to buy a one-way ticket to the city.

Nina arrived in the city with nothing but the clothes on her back and a few dollars in her pocket. She quickly realized that it was going to be a lot harder to make her dream come true here than she had originally thought. But she was determined.

She got a job as a waitress and started saving up again. After a few years of hard work, she had enough money to start her own business. And finally, after years of struggle, Nina's dream came true. She was a self-made millionaire.
