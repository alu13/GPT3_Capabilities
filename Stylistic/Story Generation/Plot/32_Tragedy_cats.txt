Write a story about cats with a "Tragedy" plot:

Lulu the cat loved nothing more than spending lazy afternoons sunbathing in her owner's backyard. She was content to lounge around all day, soaking up the warm rays of the sun. Her owner, a young girl named Sarah, would often sit outside with her, keeping her company as she napped.

One fateful day, Lulu's idyllic life came to an end. As she slept in the sun, a stray dog came into the yard and attacked her. Sarah tried to intervene, but it was too late; Lulu was gravely injured and died moments later.

The loss of her beloved cat was devastating for Sarah. She was inconsolable for weeks, barely leaving her bedroom. Lulu had been her best friend, and her death left a big hole in Sarah's life.

Lulu and her sister Lily were the closest of friends. They did everything together and were always there for each other. So when Lily suddenly became ill and died, Lulu was absolutely devastated. She moped around the house for weeks, barely eating or drinking. Her owners were worried about her, but nothing they did could snap her out of her funk.

One day, Lulu's owner decided to bring home a new kitten in the hopes that it would cheer Lulu up. At first, Lulu hissed and growled at the kitten, but eventually she warmed up to her. The kitten helped Lulu heal and finally start to move on from her sister's death.

Write a story about cats with a "Tragedy" plot:

Lulu and her litter mates were born in an alley behind a Chinese restaurant. Their mother, a scrawny tabby, did her best to care for them, but she was barely able to feed herself, let alone her six growing kittens. The restaurant owner occasionally threw them a scrap of meat or a fish head, but it was never enough.

One day, when the kittens were eight weeks old, the restaurant owner decided to get rid of them. He lured them into a box with a piece of fish, then took them to the pound and left them there.

The pound was overcrowded and the staff was overworked. The kittens were terrified and huddled together for comfort. Within a week, two of them had caught a cold and died. Lulu and her remaining littermate were adopted by a kind woman, but the trauma of their early life had taken its toll. They were both shy and withdrawn, and they never truly bonded with their new owner. They spent the rest of their lives in her home, always keeping to themselves.
