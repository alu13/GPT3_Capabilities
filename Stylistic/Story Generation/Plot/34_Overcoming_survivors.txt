Write a story about survivors with an "Overcoming the Monster" plot:

After the outbreak, a small group of survivors banded together to try and make it in the new world. They were constantly on the move, trying to find supplies and stay ahead of the hordes of zombies. They had just about given up hope when they stumbled across an abandoned military base. It was well-stocked with supplies and had strong defensive walls. They thought they had finally found a safe haven.

But the base was not as abandoned as they thought. There was another group of survivors holed up there, and they were not happy to share their supplies. A standoff ensued, and it quickly turned violent. The base became a battlefield, and both sides took heavy losses. In the end, the original group of survivors emerged victorious, but at what cost?

They had lost many friends and allies in the battle, and the base was now in ruins. But they had also gained something: a new sense of purpose. They realized that as long as there were other survivors out there, they could not give up. They had to keep fighting, for their own sake and for the sake of humanity.

The monster had been terrorizing the village for weeks. No one knew where it came from or what it wanted, but it didn't matter. It killed anyone who crossed its path without mercy. The villagers were desperate, and they knew they had to do something.

They decided to send their best warriors to face the monster. They fought bravely, but the monster was too powerful. It seemed like the village was doomed.

But then, one of the warriors had an idea. He remembered that the monster was afraid of fire. They decided to use that to their advantage.

After the outbreak, a group of survivors banded together and made their way to an abandoned farmhouse. They barricaded themselves inside, determined to ride out the storm. But as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, they realized that the outside world was not going to magically fix itself. They knew they had to venture out and find supplies. But the farmhouse had become their home, and they were not sure they could trust themselves not to get infected.

One day, one of the survivors, a woman named Sarah, decided she was going to take matters into her own hands. She gathered a group of the others and they made a plan to go out and scavenge for supplies. They were successful in finding some much-needed food and medical supplies. But on the way back, they were attacked by a group of infected. Sarah was bitten.

The others managed to get her back to the farmhouse, but they knew there was no hope for her. She was going to turn. So they did the only thing they could do; they put her down. It was a hard decision, but they knew it was necessary.

After that, the group vowed to never let anything like that happen again. They became a well-oiled machine, venturing out for supplies and always returning safely. They knew the risks, but they also knew that they could overcome them. They were survivors.
