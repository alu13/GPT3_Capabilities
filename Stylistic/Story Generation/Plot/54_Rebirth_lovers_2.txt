When they met, it was like they had known each other in a past life. They just clicked and were inseparable from that day forward. They were soulmates.

Throughout their lives together, they were always drawn to each other in moments of crisis or hardship. No matter what life threw at them, they could always rely on each other for strength and support.

In their final moments together, they shared a deep understanding of one another that could only come from many lifetimes of love. They passed away in each other's arms, content knowing that they would be together again in the next life.
