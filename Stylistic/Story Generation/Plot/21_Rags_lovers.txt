Though they met under the most unlikely of circumstances, beggar woman and wealthy man fell in love instantly. She was living on the streets, barely getting by day to day, while he was one of the richest men in the city. But none of that mattered when they were together.

He would often sneak away from his gala events and luxurious lifestyle to meet her in the alleyways and backstreets where she made her home. They would talk and laugh and dream together, and for a little while, he would forget all about his money and she would forget all about her poverty.

But eventually, their worlds would always collide. He would remember his obligations and she would remember her reality. And they would part ways, each longing for the other but knowing that it could never be.

Until one day, against all odds, he proposed to her. He told her that he loved her more than anything in the world and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. And she said yes.

In the early days of their relationship, John and Mary were very much in love. They didn't have much money, but they were happy with what they had. They would often go for walks in the park or sit in the local coffee shop and dream about their future together.

One day, John came home from work and told Mary that he had been promoted. With his new salary, they would be able to move into a nicer apartment and start saving for their future. Mary was thrilled and couldn't wait to start their new life together.

However, as the months went by, John started working longer hours and spent less time with Mary. She began to feel like she was just a convenience for him. When she confronted him about it, he told her that he was just trying to provide for their future and that she should be grateful.

Eventually, their relationship deteriorated to the point where they were barely speaking. Mary was working two jobs just to make ends meet, while John was living a life of luxury. It was clear that their relationship was over, but they still loved each other deeply.
