Write a story about cats with an "Overcoming the Monster" plot:

The cats have been living in the shelter for years, ever since they were abandoned by their previous owners. They have been through a lot together and have formed a strong bond. The shelter is their home and they are content there.

One day, a new cat arrives at the shelter. She is a scrawny street cat who is looking for a place to belong. The other cats are immediately suspicious of her and don't want her in their home.

But the street cat is relentless in her quest to be accepted. She starts by sleeping outside the door of the shelter, then slowly starts to come inside and eat with the other cats. She doesn't give up, even when they hiss and scratch at her.

Eventually, the other cats realize that she is just looking for a place to belong, like they are. They welcome her into the shelter and she becomes part of their family.

The neighborhood cats have always been afraid of the big, mean tomcat that roams the streets. He's always hissing and growling, and chasing them away whenever he sees them. One day, the tomcat sees a group of kittens playing together and he wants to chase them away, but he can't. He's getting too old and weak to chase them. The kittens don't know what to do, but they stand up to the tomcat and chase him away. Now the neighborhood cats are no longer afraid of the big, mean tomcat.

Write a story about cats with an "Overcoming the Monster" plot:

Linda loved her cats, but when she started noticing how much they were peeing outside of the litter box, she knew she had to do something. She tried everything she could think of, but nothing worked. The more she tried to stop them, the more they did it. She was at her wit's end.

One day, Linda came home and found one of her cats peeing in the middle of the living room. She was so angry that she grabbed the cat and threw it outside. The other cats followed, and Linda found herself alone in her house.

She realized then that she had been going about this all wrong. The cats weren't the problem, she was. She needed to learn to relax and let them be cats. Once she did, the problem stopped.

Another woman, Mrs. Jones, suggested that they trap the cats and take them to the shelter. This idea was met with some opposition, but it was decided that it was the best course of action.

The townspeople set to work, and within a few days they had caught all the cats. They took them to the shelter, and the town was finally rid of its feline problem.

Lily and her friends were always the outcasts at school. While the other kids played with the popular kids, Lily and her friends were stuck playing with the stray cats that roamed the school grounds. They never thought much of it, but always felt a special bond with the cats.

One day, Lily and her friends were playing near the school dumpster when they heard loud meowing coming from inside. They peered in and saw a group of kittens huddled together, scared and alone. Lily's friends wanted to ignore them, but Lily felt drawn to them. She climbed into the dumpster and scooped them up, promising to take care of them.
