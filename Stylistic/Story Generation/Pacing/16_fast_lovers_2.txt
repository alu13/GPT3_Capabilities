Write a story about lovers that is fast-paced:

The lovers were walking quickly through the city streets, hand in hand. They were laughing and joking and generally having a good time. Every so often, they would stop and kiss, looking into each others' eyes with love and desire.

They were headed to a party that they were both really excited about. It was going to be a big night, and they both wanted to make the most of it. They were planning on dancing the night away and maybe even sneaking off to a quiet corner for some alone time.

As they walked, they couldn't help but notice all of the other couples out and about. It made them feel even more special to be together. They knew that they had something special, and they were determined to enjoy every minute of it.

The party was in full swing by the time they arrived. They danced together, losing themselves in the music and each other. They had so much fun that they didn't even notice when the clock struck midnight.

It was only when they were walking home, hand in hand, that they realized that they had missed their curfew. They were both a bit worried about what would happen when they got home, but they knew that they would face it together.

No matter what happened, they knew that they would always have each other.

The lovers were on the run. They had been together for years, but never had they been so close as they were now. They were running from the law, from their families, from everyone who had ever known them. They only had each other.

They had been planning their escape for months, and everything had gone according to plan until the very last minute. They had just gotten onto the train when they heard the sirens. They knew they were coming for them.

There was no time to think. They had to act fast. They ran through the train, looking for a place to hide. But there was nowhere to go. The sirens were getting closer and closer.

Finally, they ran into a compartment and locked the door. They could hear the police searching the train, but they were safe. For now.

But they knew this was only the beginning. They were going to have to keep running if they wanted to stay together. They would never stop fighting for each other. They were in this together, forever.

The lovers raced through the night, their hearts pounding in synchronicity. They had been running for hours, and they knew they were being pursued. They didn't know who was after them or why, but they didn't care. All they cared about was each other.

As they ran, they clung to each other, their love giving them strength. They were determined to make it to safety, wherever that may be.

Suddenly, their pursuers were upon them. They didn't stand a chance against the armed men. But they refused to go down without a fight.

The lovers were running through the forest, their hearts racing, as they heard the sound of the hunters behind them. They had been running for hours, ever since they had been caught kissing in the town square. The hunters were hot on their trail and there was no turning back now.

The lovers had no choice but to keep running. They didn't know where they were going, but they had to keep moving. They ran and ran, until they came to a clearing. In the clearing was a small cabin.

The lovers ran to the cabin and went inside. They were safe, for now. But they knew that the hunters would eventually find them. They had to come up with a plan.

The lovers talked long into the night, trying to come up with a plan to escape the hunters. But they couldn't think of anything. It seemed hopeless.

Suddenly, they heard the sound of the hunters outside the cabin. They were coming closer. The lovers hugged each other tightly, knowing that this might be the end.

But then, they heard a voice calling out to them from the forest. It was a friendly voice, telling them to come with him. The voice belonged to a man on a horse.

The man on the horse was their only hope. The lovers ran to him and he took them away, just as the hunters arrived at the cabin. They were safe, for now. But they knew that they could never go back to their old life. They would have to start a new life, together, on the run.

Lovers on the run.

He stole her away in the middle of the night. She was asleep when he picked her up, carried her out of her bed and into the waiting car. They drove for hours, the only sound the hum of the engine and the soft breathing of the woman in his arms.

When they finally stopped, she woke up and looked at him, confusion and fear in her eyes. "What's going on? Where are we?" she asked.

"We're going on an adventure," he said with a smile.

And so they ran. They ran from the life they left behind, from the people who were after them. They ran to find a new life, a life together. They were in love and nothing was going to stop them.

Except maybe the people who were after them.
