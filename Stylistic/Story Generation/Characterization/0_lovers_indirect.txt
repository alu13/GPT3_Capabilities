Write a story about lovers with indirect characterization:

Though they had been dating for over a year, John and Jane's relationship was still new and fresh. They were always eager to try new things and explore new places together. That's why, when Jane suggested a weekend camping trip, John was all for it.

They packed up their gear and set off into the woods, hand in hand. The first night was cold, but they huddled together in their tent and kept each other warm. The second day was sunny and they spent it hiking and swimming in the river. They were having the time of their lives.

But on the third day, things took a turn for the worse. Jane sprained her ankle while they were out on a hike. John did his best to carry her back to the tent, but she was in a lot of pain.

They were both worried about what would happen next. But they didn't have to worry for long, because soon enough they were rescued by a group of friendly hikers. They were able to get Jane to a hospital and John was able to breathe a sigh of relief.

Though they had to cut their trip short, John and Jane both agreed that it was one of the best weekends they'd ever had. They were even more in love than before and they knew that they could overcome anything as long as they were together.

Though they had only been dating for a few months, John and Karen felt like they had been together forever. They were always on the same wavelength, finishing each other's sentences and knowing what the other was thinking without having to say a word. They were completely in sync.

One night, they were lying in bed together after making love, and John ran his fingers through Karen's hair as they gazed into each other's eyes. "I love you," he said. "I really do."

Karen smiled and kissed him gently. "I love you too," she whispered.

They both knew that this was it â€“ they were meant to be together forever. From that moment on, they were inseparable.

Though they had been dating for over a year, John and Jane's relationship was still relatively new. They were both still getting to know each other, and discovering new things about each other all the time. One of the things they loved most about each other was their sense of adventure. They loved exploring new places and trying new things together.

One weekend, they decided to go camping in the woods. They had both been camping before, but never together. They packed all their gear and set off into the woods.

After setting up their tent, they went for a hike. They were holding hands and enjoying each other's company when they came across a beautiful waterfall. They stopped to take in the sights and sounds of the waterfall. They were so captivated by the moment that they forgot to pay attention to their surroundings.

Suddenly, they heard a noise in the bushes. They turned around to see a large bear walking towards them. John and Jane were terrified. They had no idea what to do.

John tried to slowly back away from the bear, but it was coming closer and closer. Jane was shaking with fear. She was about to scream when John put his hand over her mouth to silence her.

The bear was now just a few feet away from them. John and Jane were sure they were going to die. But then, the bear stopped and sniffed the air. It seemed to be smelling something. Then, it turned and walked away.

John and Jane were relieved, but they were also shaken up by the experience. It was a close call, but they were grateful to be alive. They realized that they needed to be more careful in the future. From then on, they made sure to pay attention to their surroundings and not take any unnecessary risks.

They had been lovers for years, and yet they never tired of each other. They were always finding new things to love about each other. He loved the way she laughed; she loved the way he was always there for her.

But they never said these things aloud. They didn't need to. They could simply look at each other and know.

They were content in each other's company and didn't need anyone else. They were everything to each other.

One day, they both knew it was time to say goodbye. They didn't want to, but they knew they had to. They hugged each other tightly, and promised to always love each other.

Then they went their separate ways.

The lovers were always indirect with each other. They never said what they truly felt, and always left things unsaid. This made communication between them very difficult, and often resulted in misunderstandings. However, in spite of all their problems, they loved each other deeply and were always drawn back to each other. They knew that they weren't perfect for each other, but somehow, they just couldn't help it.
