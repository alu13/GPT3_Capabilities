However, one day, it all changed. They had a huge argument and they just couldn't seem to get past it. They stopped talking, stopped touching and stopped kissing. It was like they were two completely different people.

They tried to work things out, but it just seemed impossible. They eventually broke up and it was one of the hardest things either of them had ever had to go through.

Lovers, they were. Young, fresh-faced and in love. They couldn't keep their hands off each other, always touching, always kissing. They were the perfect match, complementing each other in every way.

People often said that they were inseparable, that they were meant to be together. And they believed it, wholeheartedly. They couldn't imagine a life without each other.

They were always laughing, always smiling. They were the epitome of happiness.

But then, one day, it all changed. They had a huge fight, the first they'd ever had. It was over something small, but it felt like the world was ending.

They didn't speak for days, the tension between them palpable. It was like living in a nightmare.

Finally, they sat down and talked it out. They both cried, and they both apologized. They swore they'd never let anything come between them again.

And they meant it. From that day forward, they were even stronger than before. They loved each other more than ever, and they knew that, no matter what happened, they'd always be together.

Samantha and Jeremy were the perfect couple. They were always there for each other when things got tough and were always eager to help out with whatever needed to be done. They were always laughing and joking around with each other, and everyone could see how much they loved each other.

One day, they went on a hike together and got lost. They didn't have any food or water with them and they were getting weaker by the minute. Samantha knew that she wouldn't be able to make it much further, but she refused to give up. Jeremy was getting weak too, but he refused to let Samantha give up.

Finally, after days of walking, they came across a cabin in the woods. They were both so weak that they could barely make it to the door, but they did. They collapsed into each other's arms, and they knew that they would never be able to leave each other's side again.
