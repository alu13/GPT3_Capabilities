Today was their anniversary and they were celebrating in the same way they always did, with a dance. As they swayed to the music, they looked into each other's eyes and knew that their love would last forever.

She was the kind of girl who always had her nose in a book. He was the kind of guy who was always looking for a good time. They were complete opposites, but somehow, they just worked.

They met in the most unlikely of places - she was working at the library and he was there trying to find a book to impress a girl he liked. They struck up a conversation and the rest, as they say, is history.

They've been together for years now and they're as happy as can be. She still loves to read and he still loves to party, but they've both found a balance that works for them. They're the perfect example of opposites attracting.

Though they had been dating for over a year, John and Jane's relationship was still as passionate as ever. They were always eager to try new things and explore new places together.

 Jane was a spontaneous lover who was always up for anything. She was always game to try new things, even if it meant getting a little bit out of her comfort zone.

John was a bit more reserved than Jane, but that only made him all the more exciting to her. She loved the way he could be so gentle and sweet one moment, and then so wild and passionate the next.

No matter what they did, or where they went, John and Jane always had a great time together. They were truly the perfect match.
