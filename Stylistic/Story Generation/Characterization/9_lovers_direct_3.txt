John and Jane had been lovers for years. They knew each other's every move, every gesture, every word. They could finish each other's sentences and knew what the other was thinking just by looking in their eyes. They were completely in sync with each other, and nothing could come between them.

Or so they thought.

One day, out of the blue, Jane told John she was leaving him. She said she'd met someone else, someone who understood her in a way John never could. John was devastated. He begged her to stay, but Jane was resolute. She packed her bags and walked out of his life, leaving John broken-hearted.

Though they had been dating for a year, Johnnie and Markie had never said "I love you." It wasn't that they didn't love each other; they were just both too scared to say it first. On this particular night, they were lying in bed together after making love, and Johnnie finally summoned up the courage to say it. "I love you, Markie," she said, her heart racing. "I love you too, Johnnie," he replied, pulling her close. From that moment on, they both knew that their relationship would last forever.
