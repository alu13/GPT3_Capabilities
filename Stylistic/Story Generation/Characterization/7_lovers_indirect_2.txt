Write a story about lovers where the characters are described indirectly:

The lovers were walking along the beach, holding hands and enjoying the sunset. They laughed and joked with each other, and it was clear that they were deeply in love. They stopped to watch the waves for a while, and then they sat down on the sand and talked. They were so engrossed in their conversation that they didn't notice the tide coming in. Suddenly, the waves were crashing around them, and they realized that they were in danger. They managed to swim to safety and they clung to each other, laughing and crying with relief. They were soaked, but they didn't care. They were just happy to be alive and to be together.

They were lovers, but you would never have known it to look at them. They were the kind of couple that never held hands in public, never walked too close to each other. But when they were alone, they couldn't keep their hands off each other. They were always touching, always kissing. They couldn't keep their eyes off each other, either. They were always looking at each other, like they were trying to memorize each other's faces.

They were happy, but they both knew that it couldn't last forever. They were from two different worlds, and eventually, those worlds would tear them apart. But for now, they were content to just be with each other, and to love each other with everything they had.

It was a love story. Two young lovers who were so in love that they couldn't stand to be apart. They were always together, always touching, always kissing. They were the perfect match.

But then, one day, something happened that tore them apart. They had a huge fight and they stopped speaking to each other. It was like a piece of their hearts had been ripped out.

They both felt lost and alone without the other. But they were too proud to admit it. They both pretended that they were fine, that they didn't need the other person.

But the truth was, they were miserable. They missed each other terribly and they wished they could just go back to the way things were.

But they never did. They never spoke again and the love they once shared was gone forever.

The lovers were always drawn to each other, even though they never spoke of their love. They would steal glances at each other when they were together, and their hearts would race when they were apart. They knew that they could never be together, but that didn't stop them from dreaming of a life where they could be.

One day, they finally decided to act on their feelings. They met in secret, away from the judgment of the world. They shared their hearts with each other, and they swore to always be there for each other. They knew that they could never be together in the way that they wanted, but they were content with being each other's secret love.
