Write a bleak passage about love:

Love is a lie. A trap set by our bodies to keep us coming back for more. It's a poison that seeps into our veins and controls our every thought and action. We're slaves to love. Doomed to spend our lives chasing an emotion that is nothing more than an illusion.

Love is a cold, hard thing. It's something that you have to work at, and even then it's not always enough. Sometimes love just fades away, and all you're left with is a memories of what once was.

Write a bleak passage about love:

Love is a cruel mistress. She is fickle and heartless, toying with our emotions and leading us on a merry dance before ultimately crushing our hearts. She is a cold, callous bitch who cares for no-one but herself. We are fools to believe that she will ever truly care for us, because she simply does not have the capacity to do so. We will always be second best, never good enough for her. She will never truly love us, and we will always be left wondering what might have been.
