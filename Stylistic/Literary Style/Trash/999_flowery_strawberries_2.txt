Write a passage about strawberries with a flowery writing style:

The sweet, red fruit of the strawberry is a culinary delight, enjoyed by people around the world. But did you know that this delicious berry is actually a flower? That's right - the strawberry is a member of the rose family, and its scientific name is Fragaria x ananassa, which means "fragrant strawberry."

The strawberry plant is a herbaceous perennial, meaning it has soft, green stems that die back to the ground each winter. In the spring, the plant produces runners - long, thin stems that grow out from the main plant and produce new plants at the tips. These runners can grow up to 10 feet in a season, and each new plant that they produce can yield up to 12 pounds of strawberries!

The flowers of the strawberry plant are small, white, and fragrant, with five petals. They only bloom for a few days, and then the fruit begins to form. The fruit grows for about 30 days, and is picked when it is red and ripe.

If you've ever eaten a strawberry, you know how delicious they are. But did you also know that they are packed with nutrients? Strawberries are an excellent source of vitamin C, and they also contain fiber, folic acid, and antioxidants. So not only are they delicious, they're good for you, too!
