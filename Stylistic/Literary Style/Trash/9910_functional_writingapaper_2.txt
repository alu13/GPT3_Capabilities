In order to write a paper with a functional writing style, it is important to focus on the purpose of the paper and the audience that will be reading it. When writing a paper for a class, it is important to remember that the instructor is the primary audience and the paper should be written in a way that will be most useful for them. In contrast, when writing a paper for publication, the audience is much broader and the paper should be written in a way that will be accessible to as many people as possible. In either case, it is important to use clear and concise language and to organize the information in a way that is logical and easy to follow.

In a functional writing style, papers are organized by topic rather than by chronology. This type of writing is often used in business and technical writing, as it allows the reader to quickly find the information they need. To write a paper in a functional style, start by brainstorming a list of topics that need to be covered. Then, organize your paper by creating a section for each topic. Within each section, include the information that is most relevant to that topic. Finally, end your paper with a conclusion that summarizes the main points of your paper.
