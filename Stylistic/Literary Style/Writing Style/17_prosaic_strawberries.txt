Write a prosaic passage about strawberries:

In the early morning, the sun just peeking over the horizon, the dew still fresh on the ground, I walk out to the strawberry patch. Rows and rows of green plants, with the occasional red fruit dotting the foliage, stretch out before me. I bend down, gently cupping a ripe strawberry in my hand, and pull it off the plant. The fruit is warm from the sun, and the sweetness explodes in my mouth as I bite into it. I can't help but smile as I eat strawberry after strawberry, enjoying the taste of summer.
