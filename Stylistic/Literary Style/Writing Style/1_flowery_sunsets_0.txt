Sunset is the time when the sun goes down in the west and the sky becomes red and orange. It is a beautiful time of day, and many people enjoy watching the sunset. The colors of the sunset are due to the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere. Sunsets are often followed by a period of twilight, when the sky is still light but the sun has gone down.
