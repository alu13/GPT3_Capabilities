Write a poetic passage about strawberries:

The strawberries are ripe
and ready to be picked.
The sun has been shining
and the rain has been falling,
just the right amount
to make them sweet and juicy.

We can't wait to eat them
straight off the vine,
or to bake them into a pie.

The possibilities are endless
with these little red gems,
and we can't wait to enjoy them
all summer long.

The sweetest strawberries
Are the ones we grow
In our own backyard

We love to pick them
Right off the vine
And eat them
All up

We can't help but smile
Whenever we eat them

Strawberries are the perfect fruit
Sweet, juicy, and red
They are the embodiment of summer
And the taste of happiness

I can't think of a better way
To enjoy a sunny day
Than to sit in the shade
And eat strawberries

Their sweetness is like candy
And their flavor is divine
I could eat them all day
And never get tired

That will make you feel good
Grab some strawberries
And enjoy their deliciousness
