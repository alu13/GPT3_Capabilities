When writing a paper, there are a few things that you should always keep in mind. First, make sure that you have a clear thesis statement that you are trying to argue. Without a thesis, your paper will likely not have a clear structure or argument. Second, make sure that you have evidence to support your claims. This can be in the form of quotes, statistics, or anything else that supports your argument. Third, make sure that your paper is well-organized and flows smoothly. This means having a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. Finally, make sure that you edit and proofread your paper before turning it in. Even the best writers make mistakes, so it is always important to double check your work.
