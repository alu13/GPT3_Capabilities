The act of writing a paper can be a very daunting task. For some, the mere thought of having to sit down and compose a paper is enough to send them into a panic. However, with a little bit of planning and preparation, the process of writing a paper can be much less daunting.

The first step in writing a paper is to choose a topic. It is important to choose a topic that is interesting and relevant to the class or assignment.

When you sit down to write a paper, you may feel overwhelmed by the task ahead of you. However, with a little planning and organisation, you can get the job done.

Start by reading over your assignment carefully. Make sure you understand what is being asked of you. If you have any questions, be sure to ask your instructor for clarification.
