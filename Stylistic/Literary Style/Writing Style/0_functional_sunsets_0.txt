Write a functional passage about sunsets:

A sunset is the daily event of the sun descending below the horizon in the west, due to Earth's rotation. Sunsets usually occur in the evening, but can also take place in the morning or afternoon. They typically last for a few minutes, and often take on a reddish hue due to the scattering of sunlight through the atmosphere.

There's something about a sunset that just makes you feel alive. Maybe it's the way the colors seem to explode in the sky, or the way the sun slowly dip below the horizon. Whatever the reason, sunsets always seem to leave us in awe.

If you're ever feeling down, just go outside and watch the sunset. It's impossible to watch a sunset and not feel your spirits lift. So next time you're feeling low, just step outside and enjoy the show.
