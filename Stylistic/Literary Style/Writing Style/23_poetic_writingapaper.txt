Write a poetic passage about writing a paper:

The paper is due at noon and I have yet to start.
I sit at my desk and stare at the blank screen.
My mind is a blank as well.
I have no idea what to write.

The clock ticks away and the minutes fly by.
The paper is due in an hour and I'm no closer to done.
I start to type and the words come slowly at first.
But as I get into the flow, the words start to come faster.
And before I know it, I'm done.

Write a poetic passage about writing a paper:

The best way to write a paper
Is to start with a clean slate
And a mind that is free of clutter
Then let the words flow from your fingertips 
And onto the page
Like a river of thoughts
That has been dammed up for too long

The ideas will come rushing out
In a torrent of words and phrases
And before you know it
You will have a paper that is worthy of an A

Is like a journey on a ship

Your paper until it is perfect

Write a poetic passage about writing a paper:

The paper is due tomorrow
and I haven't even started
I sit down at my desk
and stare at the blank screen
wondering where to begin

I think about the topic
and what I want to say
I try to organize my thoughts
and put them into words
but the longer I sit here
the more they evade me

The clock ticks away
and the minutes turn to hours
I'm getting nowhere
and I'm starting to panic

I force myself to keep going
and finally some words come
but they don't make much sense
and I'm not sure they're right

I keep typing anyway
because I have to finish
this paper is my only hope
of passing the class

I'm running out of time
and I'm running out of ideas
but I can't give up
I have to keep going

The paper is due tomorrow
and I'm still not done
but I'm getting there
one word at a time

Write a poetic passage about writing a paper:

The act of writing a paper
Is a very special thing
You get to sit down and think
And let your thoughts just flow

It's a way to get your ideas out
And to make them heard
You can express yourself
In a way that's very clear

A paper is a way to communicate
With the world around you
And to share your ideas
With others who may be interested

So when you sit down to write a paper
Remember to be true to yourself
And let your thoughts come out
In the best way possible

Write a poetic passage about writing a paper:

The act of writing a paper
Is one of great importance
For it allows us to share our thoughts
And communicate our ideas
With others who may not be near
In physical space, but who
Are connected to us through
The written word.

There is something magical
About taking the thoughts
That are swirling around in our heads
And putting them down on paper
In a way that makes sense
To us and to others.

It is a way of organizing
Our thoughts and bringing them
Into the light of day
So that we can examine them
More closely and see
What it is that we really think.
