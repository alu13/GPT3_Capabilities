I've never been in love before, but I can imagine it must be wonderful.

I must admit, I am a little envious of those who have experienced that kind of love.

I've never felt more loved than I do now. I never knew that love could be so all-consuming, so all-encompassing. I am consumed by my love for him, and it feels so good. I never knew that love could make me feel so alive. Every time he looks at me, I feel like I'm the only person in the world. I never knew that love could be so intoxicating. I am drunk on my love for him, and I never want to sober up.

I have never been in love, but I imagine it feels something like this: Your stomach flutters every time you see them. You can't concentrate on anything else. You are constantly thinking about them even when you're not with them. You would do anything for them. You would give up anything for them. You would do anything to make them happy. You would sacrifice anything to keep them safe. You would do anything to keep them in your life.
