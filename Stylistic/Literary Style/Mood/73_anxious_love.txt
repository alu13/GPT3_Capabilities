Write a passage about love that makes the reader feel anxious:

Love is a strange and volatile thing. It can make you feel on top of the world one minute and like you're teetering on the edge of a precipice the next. It's exhilarating and scary all at once. You never quite know where you stand with love. It's always changing and moving, like a wave crashing against the shore. You can never predict what it will do next. That's what makes love so exciting, and also so anxiety-inducing. You never know where you stand, and you never know what's going to happen next.

Write a passage about love that makes the reader feel anxious:

Love is often described as a feeling of strong affection and requires both positive and negative aspects, such as patience and sacrifice, to maintain. Love also has the potential to make people feel vulnerable and anxious, as it exposes them to potential heartbreak and disappointment. When we love someone, we open ourselves up to the possibility of being hurt, and this can be a scary thing.

Write a passage about love that makes the reader feel anxious:

Love is anxious. It's anxious because it's never certain. You never know if the person you love is going to stay with you or leave you. You never know if they're going to hurt you or make you happy. You never know if you're going to be able to handle it when they do leave you. And worst of all, you never know if you're going to be able to survive if they die.

These fears can create a great deal of anxiety, but they are also a testament to the power of love. Love is worth the risk, even if it means feeling a little bit anxious.
