Life can be so hard sometimes. It feels like everything is against you and you just can't catch a break.

Life can be so hard sometimes. You can be doing everything right, but things can still go wrong. You can try your best to be happy, but sometimes you just can't seem to shake the sadness. It can feel like you're stuck in a dark hole that you can't climb out of. The people around you can seem so happy and you can't help but wonder what you're doing wrong. Life can be so unfair.

In a blink, life can change. One moment you're happy and carefree, and the next you're faced with something that completely rocks your world. It's hard to keep going when it feels like everything is against you, but you have to keep fighting. Life isn't always fair, but it's still beautiful. Even in the darkest of times, there's still a glimmer of hope.

Write a passage about life that makes the reader feel sad:

I wake up every morning to the sound of my alarm clock, and I dread the thought of another day. I drag myself out of bed and get ready for the day, feeling like I'm just going through the motions. I go to my job that I hate and I sit in my cubicle, counting down the hours until I can go home. I eat lunch by myself in the break room, feeling like I'm the only one who is always alone. I go home to my empty apartment, and I sit on my couch, flipping through channels, looking for something to take my mind off of my life. I go to bed, and I cry myself to sleep, wondering why I'm even bother living anymore.

I never thought that life would be so hard. I always thought that it would be easy, that I would just be able to float through it. But it's not like that at all. Life is hard, and it's full of pain. I can't even count the number of times that I've been hurt, both physically and emotionally. I've been through so much pain, and it feels like it's never going to end. I just want to give up sometimes, but I can't. I have to keep going, even though I don't know why.
