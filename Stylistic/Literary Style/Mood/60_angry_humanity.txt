Write a passage about humanity that makes the reader feel angry:

It is a sad day when we as a species have to admit that we are not as great as we thought we were. That we are in fact, quite flawed. We are angry at ourselves for all of the things we have done wrong, all of the innocent people we have hurt, all of the pain we have caused. We are a species that is capable of great love and great evil, and it seems that we can never find a balance. We are always swinging from one extreme to the other, and it is tearing us apart. We are angry at ourselves for what we have become, and we are angry at the world for not being able to fix us.

Write a passage about humanity that makes the reader feel angry:

 Humanity is the worst thing in the world. Every day, people kill each other over stupid things. They destroy the environment and they don't care about anyone but themselves. They're always fighting and they never seem to learn from their mistakes. They're greedy and they're never satisfied. They're always looking for ways to make themselves feel better, even if it means making someone else feel worse. They're selfish and they don't care about anything but themselves. They're always trying to get ahead, even if it means stepping on somebody else to do it.

Write a passage about humanity that makes the reader feel angry:

It is a sad commentary on humanity that we so often turn a blind eye to the suffering of others. We see the homeless man on the street and do not give him a second thought. We see the starving children in Africa and think that there is nothing we can do to help. We see the refugees fleeing war-torn countries and think that it is not our problem. It is easy to turn away from the suffering of others, but it is not right. We should all be outraged by the injustice and suffering in the world, and we should all be working to make it right.

Write a passage about humanity that makes the reader feel angry:

Humans are the most destructive, short-sighted, and cruel creatures to ever walk the earth. They care about nothing but themselves and their own selfish desires.

Write a passage about humanity that makes the reader feel angry:

How could they? How could they be so cruel? How could they be so heartless? How could they be so inhuman?

It's sickening, it really is. The way they just treat us like animals, like we're nothing. They think they can just do whatever they want to us, and we'll just take it. They think we're just going to sit here and take it, but they're wrong. We're not going to take it anymore.

We're going to fight back. We're going to show them that we're not going to take their crap anymore. We're going to stand up for ourselves, and we're going to make them pay. They're going to regret ever messing with us. We're going to make them wish they had never been born.

It is a shame that humanity has not progressed further. We are still so barbaric, killing each other over petty disagreements. We have not learned to live in peace with each other, and it seems like we never will.

It is truly sickening how little humanity some people have. To see people mistreat others, to see people be so selfish and only think about themselves- it makes me absolutely furious. How can people be so cruel? How can people be so heartless? It's disgusting and it's one of the worst things about being human.

Write a passage about humanity that makes the reader feel angry:

It is a travesty that humanity has not yet learned to live in peace with one another. Every day, innocent people are caught in the crossfire of wars, terrorist attacks, and hate crimes. Children are being orphaned, families are being torn apart, and entire communities are being destroyed. When will we learn that violence is not the answer?
