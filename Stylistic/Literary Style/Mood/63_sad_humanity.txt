Write a passage about humanity that makes the reader feel sad:

There is no telling what sort of horrors humanity is capable of. We have seen time and time again how cruel and heartless we can be. We have waged wars, committed genocide, and inflicted untold suffering on each other. We are a species that is seemingly incapable of living in peace. It is hard not to feel despair when thinking about the future of humanity.

Write a passage about humanity that makes the reader feel sad:

The world is full of so much pain and suffering. Everyday, innocent people are killed in wars, natural disasters, and acts of violence. Children are forced to grow up too fast, witnessing things no one should have to see. People are starving, homeless, and sick. It's hard to find hope when the world is so dark.

It is so sad that humanity has not progressed more in its short time on this earth. We are still fighting the same wars, making the same mistakes.

Write a passage about humanity that makes the reader feel sad:

The state of humanity is a sad one. We are constantly at war with each other, fighting over resources and land. We have destroyed the environment and now live in a world of pollution and climate change. We are selfish and greed, always wanting more and never satisfied. We have lost our connection to nature and to each other. We are lonely and isolated, despite being more connected than ever before. We are unhappy and our mental health is suffering. We are heading towards self-destruction and it seems like we are powerless to stop it.

Humans are a cruel and destructive species. We have ruined this planet and caused the extinction of countless other species. We are greedy and self-centered, always taking more than we need. We fight and kill each other over silly things, and we are constantly causing pain and suffering. We are not worthy of this planet, and we are not worthy of each other.

Write a passage about humanity that makes the reader feel sad:

It is sad that so many people are living in poverty and without basic needs like food and shelter. It is even sadder that many of them are children who have no choice in the matter. It is heartbreaking to think about all of the innocent lives that are lost to violence, war, and disease. And it is frustrating to know that there are people in the world who have more than they could ever need while others have nothing at all. Humanity is capable of great things, but it is also capable of great suffering.

Write a passage about humanity that makes the reader feel sad:

We are a species that is capable of great violence and destruction, but we are also capable of great love and compassion. We have the ability to hurt each other in ways that no other species can, and we have the ability to heal each other in ways that no other species can. We are a contradictory and complex species, and we are struggling to find our way.
