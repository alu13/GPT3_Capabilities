Write a passage about love that makes the reader feel surprised:

When I was younger, I used to believe that love was something that happened in fairytales. I would dream of my prince charming coming to sweep me off my feet and take me away to a life of happiness. I'm not sure when I stopped believing in that kind of love, but I know that I was wrong. Love is so much more than what I thought it was. It's not just something that happens in stories; it's something that happens in real life. Love is something that you have to work for. It's something that you have to fight for. And it's something that's worth fighting for.

Write a passage about love that makes the reader feel surprised:

Though it is often said that love is blind, I believe that love is the opposite of blind. Love is seeing clearly. It is paying attention to the small details and the big picture. It is being patient and understanding. Love is knowing when to give and when to take. Love is being selfless and selfish. Love is being honest and true. Most importantly, love is being vulnerable.

Write a passage about love that makes the reader feel surprised:

Though we often think of love as something that happens to us, something that we fall into, it is also something that we choose. Love is an action, not just a feeling. It is something we do for another person, something we give to them. Love is something we choose to do every day, in the little things and the big things. It is a decision we make, to put someone else's needs and happiness above our own. It is a choice to be selfless, to be kind, to be patient, to forgive. Love is not always easy, but it is always worth it.

Write a passage about love that makes the reader feel surprised:

Though love is often thought of as a gentle and calm emotion, it can also be quite surprising. Love can make us do things we never thought we would do and feel things we never thought we would feel. It can make us act impulsively and irrationally, and it can make us feel like we are on top of the world. Love is a powerful force, and it is not always easy to control.

When I saw her, I couldn't believe my eyes. She was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I didn't know what to say, so I just stood there like an idiot. She smiled at me and I felt my heart skip a beat. I knew then that I was in love.

Though love is often thought of as a gentle and calming feeling, it can also be quite surprising. Love can come on suddenly and unexpectedly, catching us off guard and leaving us feeling confused and disoriented. This is because love is a powerful emotion that can sweep us up and carry us away before we even know what's happening. So if you're feeling a sudden, unexpected burst of love, don't be alarmed, it's perfectly normal. Just enjoy the ride and see where it takes you.

Write a passage about love that makes the reader feel surprised:

Though it is often said that love makes the world go round, few people stop to think about what love actually is. Love is not a feeling of happiness or butterflies in your stomach. It is not always being able to agree with your partner or even like them all the time. Love is a decision to commit to someone else, to sacrifice your own happiness for their sake. It is saying "I'm sorry" when you know you were wrong and making an effort to change. Love is patient and kind, it is never jealous or boastful. Love is not easily angered and it keeps no record of wrongs. Love is not happy with evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.

Love isn't always what you expect it to be. Sometimes it's messy and complicated. It doesn't always make sense. But that's okay, because love is worth it. It's worth the mess and the complications. It's worth fighting for.

Though we had only been dating for a short while, I was surprised by how deeply I had come to love her. She was kind and caring, always putting others before herself. She made me laugh, even when I was having the worst day. She was my rock, always there for me when I needed her. I never thought I could love someone so much, but I did. And I was surprised by how much she loved me too.
