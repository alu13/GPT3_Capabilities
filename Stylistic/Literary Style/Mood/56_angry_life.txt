Write a passage about life that makes the reader feel angry:

Life is so unfair! I work so hard and I'm still stuck in this crappy job with no hope of ever getting ahead. I've been passed over for promotions time and time again, while my lazy co-workers who do half the work get all the credit. It's not right! I'm so sick of being taken advantage of and not getting what I deserve.

I'm sick of this life. I'm sick of feeling like I'm not good enough, like I'm not worth anything. I'm sick of feeling like I'm just a screw up who can't do anything right.

I'm sick of always being the one who has to try harder, who has to work twice as hard as everyone else just to get half as far. I'm sick of feeling like I'm not good enough, like I'm not worth anything.

I'm sick of this life. I'm sick of feeling like I'm not good enough, like I'm not worth anything. I'm sick of feeling like I'm just a screw up who can't do anything right.

Write a passage about life that makes the reader feel angry:

Life is a never-ending series of disappointments. Every day, we're faced with new challenges and obstacles, and we can never seem to catch a break. We're constantly being let down by the people we trust, and it seems like the deck is always stacked against us. It's hard to find any joy or happiness when life is constantly kicking us when we're down.

The rich get richer while the poor get poorer. The deck is stacked against those who are struggling to make ends meet. The system is rigged to benefit the powerful and the wealthy. Everyday, it feels like the deck is being stacked a little bit more against us.

Write a passage about life that makes the reader feel angry:

It's not fair. It's just not fair. Why does life have to be so hard? Why can't things just be easy for once? It's not like I'm asking for much, I just want a little bit of happiness. But no, that's too much to ask. Life just keeps throwing obstacles in my way and I'm so tired of it. I'm so tired of being tired. I just want to give up.

I'm sick of being told that I need to change, that I need to be someone else. I'm sick of being told that I'm not good enough the way I am. I'm done with all of this.

I'm done with feeling like I'm not good enough. I'm done with feeling like I'm worthless. I'm done with feeling like I'm a screw up.

I'm done with this life.

Write a passage about life that makes the reader feel angry:

In a world where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, it's hard to believe that life is fair. Every day, we see people who have more than they could ever need, while others can barely make ends meet. It's not right that some people have to struggle so hard just to get by, while others have more money than they could ever spend.
