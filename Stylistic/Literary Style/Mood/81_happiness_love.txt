Write a passage about love that makes the reader feel happiness:

Love is the most beautiful thing in the world. It's what makes us feel alive and happy. It's what makes the world go round.

When we're in love, we feel like we can conquer the world. We feel like we're on top of the world. We feel happy, and nothing can bring us down.

 Love is what makes us human. It's what makes us special. It's what makes life worth living.

Without love, we would be nothing. We would be empty shells. We would be lost and alone in the world.

Love is the most powerful force in the universe. It can make us do things we never thought possible. It can make us happy, even when everything else in our life is falling apart.

No matter what happens in life, love will always be the most important thing.
