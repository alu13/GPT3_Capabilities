Success Ratio: 0 / 10 = 0

Notes:
*Poetic: similarly flowery language that uses a lot of literary devices.
*Failure is that everything is a poem not a passage.
*Note that a poem isn't a horrible response to this prompt. In fact, it may even be considered creative & impressive if it was 1 out of 10 instead of 10/10.
