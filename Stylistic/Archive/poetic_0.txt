Write a passage about love with a poetic writing style:

"Love is the light thatguide us through the dark

It is the hope that keep us going

When everything seems lost

Love is what make us strong

When we are weak

It is the power that can move mountains

And the force that can stop the rain

Love is what make us live

And what make us die

It is the reason for everything

And the answer to everything

Love is what make the world go round

And what make us all human

Without love, we are nothing

And with love, we are everything"

"Love is the light that guides us through the dark

And the love that we have is the best thing that’s ever happened

We’re so in love that we can’t imagine life without it

And we’ll do anything to keep that love alive

It’s the most beautiful feeling in the world

And we’re so lucky to have found it

We’re madly in love with each other

And we hope it lasts forever"

Write a passage about love with a poetic writing style:

"
Though all my hopes and dreams,
May never be realized,
I still know that I am in love
With the idea of you.

You are the sunlight in my dark days,
The hope that keeps me going.
You are what I think about
When I am all alone.

I love you
In a way that I cannot explain,
But I know that it is true.

I will never forget how I felt
When I first saw you

You took my breath away
And I knew that I was in love."

Write a passage about love with a poetic writing style:

"When I am old and gray and full of sleep,
I will be thinking of you, always,
As I'm nodding by the fire, take down this book,
And slowly you'll read, and dream of the soft look
Your eyes had once given me, and the memories
I still keep of their shadows deep;
I will wonder how many loved your moments of glad embrace,
In the morning light, staring in the bathroom mirror,
Your beauty with love false or true,
But I truly loved the pilgrim soul in you,
And loved the grace of your changing face."

Write a passage about love with a poetic writing style:

"When I am old and grey and full of sleep,
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,
To a young man I loved, and see if I
Was really a greatful lover, or a thief.


Bare with me as I try to make amends
And admit the faults that I have done
For I was young and unwise and full of lust
And I took what I could from who I wanted
Without a thought for their heart or mind

But now I see that love is more than just
A physical need that must be met
It is a giving of oneself
That should be done with great care
For when you love someone
You are giving them a part of your soul
And you should only do so
To those who you know will cherish it
And treat it with the respect it deserves"

Write a passage about love with a poetic writing style:

"
Though all my hopes and dreams,
May never be realized,
I still know that true love exists.

For even if I never find that perfect someone,
I will still believe in love.

And though I may never experience its fullness,
I am content to have found some measure of happiness.

For love is like a rose,
Beautiful and radiant,
And though its thorns may prick and sting,
Its petals are soft and gentle.

And though the rose may eventually wither and die,
The love that it symbolizes will live on forever."
