After a long and difficult life, Mary finally died peacefully in her sleep. As she entered the afterlife, she was surprised to find that she was not met with the pearly gates, but instead a dark and foreboding forest. She was about to turn and run back the way she came when a voice stopped her.

"Welcome, Mary. I am glad you have finally joined us."

"Who are you? And where is this place?"

"This is the Forest of Lost Souls. It is a place for those who have lost their way in life."

"But I don't understand. I thought I was going to Heaven."

"Heaven is for those who have led good and virtuous lives. You, Mary, have done neither. But do not worry, all is not lost. You have the opportunity to start anew. If you can find your way out of this forest, you will be reborn into a new life."

And with that, Mary was off. She didn't know where she was going, but she knew she had to find a way out. She walked for days, getting more and more lost, until she finally came to a clearing. In the center of the clearing was a tree with a bright light shining from its trunk.

"This is it," she thought. "This is my way out."

She walked to the tree and reached for the light. But as her hand touched it, she was filled with a warmth and peace that she had never felt before. She knew then that she had found her way home.
