Write a story about survivors with a “The Quest" plot:

The world as we know it ended in a cataclysmic event that left few survivors. Those that did survive were left with a burning desire to find out what caused the event. They formed groups and set out on a quest to find answers.

The journey was long and hard, but they persevered. They faced many challenges along the way, but they never gave up. Finally, after years of searching, they found a clue. It was a piece of a device that they had never seen before.

 They took it to the best scientists they could find and they began to study it. They quickly realized that this device was responsible for the cataclysm. They also realized that there were more of these devices out there.

The survivors now had a new quest: to find all of the devices and destroy them before they could cause any more damage. They knew it wouldn’t be easy, but they were determined to succeed.

As they are exploring, they hear a noise coming from one of the rooms. They cautiously approach, and find a group of people huddled together in the corner. They are all scared and starving, and the survivors can see that they are in bad shape.
