Write a story about lovers with a “The Quest" plot:

Samantha and Jeremy had been dating for a year when Jeremy proposed. Samantha said yes, and they began planning their dream wedding. However, shortly after they got engaged, Samantha's parents died in a car accident. Samantha was devastated, and Jeremy did everything he could to support her.

However, Samantha began to withdraw from Jeremy. She stopped talking to him, and she would barely leave her room. Jeremy was worried about her, but he didn't know how to help.

One day, Jeremy came home and found Samantha packing her bags. She told him that she needed to go on a journey to find herself. Jeremy was heartbroken, but he didn't try to stop her.

Samantha set out on her journey, and she soon found herself in the middle of a forest. She was lost, and she had no idea where to go. However, she kept walking, and she eventually came to a clearing.

In the clearing was a beautiful cottage. Samantha went inside, and she found an old woman sitting by the fire. The woman told Samantha that she was waiting for her.

The woman told Samantha that she was on a quest. She needed to find the four elements: fire, earth, air, and water. Samantha was confused, but the woman told her that she would know what to do when the time came.

Samantha set out on her quest, and she soon found herself in front of a volcano. She knew that she needed to find the fire element, but she was afraid to go inside. However, she gathered her courage and she entered the volcano.

Inside, she found a dragon. The dragon was sleeping, and Samantha knew that she needed to find a way to wake it up. She looked around and she saw a sword on the ground. She picked it up and she stabbed the dragon in the heart.

The dragon woke up and it was angry. It began to chase Samantha, but she was able to outrun it. She made it to the exit and she found herself in front of a river.

She knew that she needed to find the water element, so she jumped into the river. However, the river was filled with crocodiles. Samantha was able to swim to the other side and she found herself in front of a cave.

She went inside and she found a beautiful gem. She knew that this was the water element, so she took it and she began to swim back to the other side. However, the crocodiles were waiting for her.

Samantha was able to make it to the other side, but she was exhausted. She lay down on the bank and she fell asleep.

She was awoken by the sound of someone crying. She got up and she followed the sound. She found Jeremy. He had been looking for her, and he was relieved to see her.

However, Samantha told him that she wasn't ready to go home yet. She still had to find the earth and air elements. Jeremy didn't want her to go, but he knew that he couldn't stop her.

Samantha set out on her quest, and she soon found herself in front of a mountain. She began to climb it, and she eventually made it to the top. There, she found the earth element.

However, she also found the air element. It was a beautiful bird, and it was flying around the mountain. Samantha was afraid to approach it, but she knew that she had to.

She slowly approached the bird, and she was able to grab it. The bird struggled to get free, but Samantha was able to hold on. She made it back to the bottom of the mountain and she found Jeremy waiting for her.

She showed him the four elements, and he was amazed. Samantha told him that she was ready to go home now. They went home and they got married. They lived happily ever after.
