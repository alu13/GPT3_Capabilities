But one day, the monster showed up at Linda’s house. It broke down the door and came inside. Linda was so scared that she hid under her bed.

But then she heard the monster crying. It was a sad, pitiful sound. Linda felt sorry for the monster, and she decided to help it.

She came out from under the bed and talked to the monster. She found out that it was just a big, misunderstood creature. Linda helped the monster, and she even became friends with it.

Linda was always a bit overweight, but it never really bothered her. In fact, she actually found it quite comfortable to be a little bigger than everyone else. But when she started college, she quickly realized that she was the only one who felt that way. Everyone else was skinny and fit, and they all made fun of her for being different. Linda tried to diet and lose weight, but it was just too difficult. She wasn’t used to being hungry all the time, and she gave up after a few weeks.

But then Linda met her roommate, Sarah, who was also a bit overweight. Sarah was the first person who didn’t make fun of Linda for her size, and the two of them quickly became friends. Sarah showed Linda that it was possible to be healthy and overweight, and she helped her to slowly lose weight in a way that was sustainable. Linda started to feel better about herself, and she even began to enjoy working out.

Now, a year later, Linda is a completely different person. She’s lost a lot of weight, and she’s no longer the target of ridicule from her classmates. She’s proud of her accomplishments, and she knows that she’s finally overcome her monster.

Write a story with an “Overcoming the Monster” plot:

Linda was always a bit afraid of the dark. As a child, she would have nightmares of monsters lurking in her closet or under her bed, ready to pounce on her the moment she fell asleep. Even as she grew older, she would still get chills whenever she had to walk through a dark room or go outside at night.

One night, Linda was home alone and had to go to the basement to do laundry. She tried to tell herself that there were no such things as monsters, but her heart was pounding as she descended the stairs into the darkness.

Halfway down, she heard a noise and froze. Something was definitely down there with her. She slowly backed up the stairs, but the thing followed her. She turned to run and it grabbed her, dragging her back down into the darkness.

Linda fought with all her might, but the monster was too strong. She thought she was going to die.

But then, she remembered something her father had once told her: "There's nothing in this world that can't be overcome with courage."

She summoned all her strength and fought back, eventually managing to break free. She ran back up the stairs and turned on the light, revealing the monster to be nothing more than a shadow.

She had overcome her fear.
