 They met when they were both working at the local grocery store. He was the bag boy and she was the cashier. They would smile at each other and sometimes chat when there wasn't a line of customers. They both knew they were attracted to each other, but neither made a move.

One day, he finally got the courage to ask her out and she said yes. They went on a few dates and quickly fell in love. They were happy just being with each other and didn't need anything else.

However, fate had other plans. He was laid off from his job and she was promoted. Suddenly, their roles were reversed and she was the one with the steady income. He felt like a burden to her and their relationship became strained.

He started looking for work, but it was hard to find anything in the current economic climate. She tried to be supportive, but he could tell she was getting impatient. Finally, he landed a job as a janitor at her office building. It wasn't the ideal situation, but it was a start.

Now, they are both working their way up the corporate ladder. She is still the breadwinner, but he is contributing more and more as they continue to climb. They are happy and in love, and they cherish each other even more because of the hard times they had to overcome together.
