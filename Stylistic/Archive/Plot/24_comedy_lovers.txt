Though they had been dating for over a year, Jane and John had never said "I love you." It wasn't that they didn't love each other, they were just both too stubborn to be the first one to say it.

One day, they were both having a terrible day. Jane had gotten into a fight with her best friend, and John had been laid off from his job. They were both feeling down and out.

When they met up that night, they decided to just be honest with each other and finally say those three little words. But, as soon as they said them, they both started laughing. It was just too perfect and too funny that they had both finally said "I love you" on the worst day of their lives.

Though it wasn't the most romantic moment, it was definitely the funniest and most memorable. From then on, they knew that they could always count on each other, no matter what.
