Once upon a time, there were three cats who lived together in a house. They were best friends and did everything together. One day, they were playing in the backyard and ran into a group of other cats. These cats were different than they were— they were mean and they hissed and scratched at the three friends. The three friends were scared and ran away.

They ran back to their house and hid under the bed. They didn’t want to come out and they didn’t want to see any other cats ever again.

But one day, one of the three friends started to feel curious. She wanted to know what was out there and if there were any other cats who were like her. So she bravely left the safety of their home and ventured out into the world.

She met other cats, and some of them were nice and some of them were not. But she kept going, and she learned a lot about the world and about herself.

Eventually, she made her way back home to her two friends. She was different now— she was more confident and she knew who she was. And she was ready to start a new life with her two best friends.
