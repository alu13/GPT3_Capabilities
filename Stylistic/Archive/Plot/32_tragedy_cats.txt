Once upon a time, there were two cats who loved each other very much. They would spend hours playing together, cuddling and purring. They were the best of friends.

One day, tragedy struck. One of the cats became very ill and had to be put to sleep. The other cat was heartbroken.

For weeks, the surviving cat moped around the house, grieving for her lost friend. She refused to eat or play. Her humans became worried and took her to the vet.

The vet diagnosed the cat with depression and prescribed medication. With time and care, the cat slowly started to recover. But she would never be the same again. She would always remember her lost friend and the happy times they shared together.
