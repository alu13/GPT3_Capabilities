Write a story with a “Comedy” plot:

When the world ended, nobody was laughing.

That was the problem.

The apocalypse came without warning. One minute the sun was shining and the birds were singing; the next, the sky was dark and filled with the howls of demons.

 Humanity didn’t stand a chance.

But in the midst of all the terror and destruction, one man continued to laugh.

Some said he was crazy; others said he was brave. But nobody knew why he found the situation so funny.

As the world crumbled around him, the laughing man continued to find humor in the darkness.

And then, one day, he found himself alone in a world filled with death and destruction.

But he still laughed.

Because even in the darkest of times, laughter is the best medicine.

Lena and her best friend, Sarah, were always up for a good time. So when they saw the flyer for the open mic night at the local comedy club, they knew they had to go.

Neither of them had any experience performing stand-up, but they figured it couldn't be that hard. They wrote a few jokes, practiced their delivery, and headed to the club.

They were the first to sign up and were told they would be going on first. As they waited backstage, they could hear the crowd getting rowdy.

Sarah started to get nervous, but Lena reassured her that they would be fine.

When their names were called, they walked out to a room full of people jeering and booing.

Lena's heart sank, but she tried to keep a brave face. Sarah was frozen in terror.

The crowd started throwing things at them and they quickly ran off the stage.

They were humiliated, but they knew they would never live this down. They would never try stand-up comedy again.
