Though they had been dating for over a year, John and Jane’s relationship was anything but smooth sailing. They were constantly fighting and making up, never quite sure if they were meant to be together or not. But despite all of the turmoil, they loved each other deeply and were determined to make it work.

One night, after a particularly heated argument, John stormed out of the house and drove off, not knowing where he was going or what he was going to do. He ended up at a secluded spot by the river, where he sat in his car and contemplated his life.

Suddenly, he saw a figure walking towards him in the darkness. It was Jane. She had followed him and found him. They hugged each other tightly, both realizing that they couldn’t bear to be apart. From that moment on, they vowed to never let anything come between them again. They had overcome the biggest monster of all: themselves.
