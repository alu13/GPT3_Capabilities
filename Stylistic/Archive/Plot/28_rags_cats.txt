Once upon a time, there were two cats who were living in the same house. One of the cats was very lazy and always slept all day. The other cat was very active and always ran around. The active cat always brought home food for the lazy cat, but the lazy cat never did anything to help.

One day, the active cat found a gold coin on the street. The lazy cat saw the gold coin and asked the active cat to give it to him. The active cat said that he would only give it to the lazy cat if he helped him to get more gold coins. So, the lazy cat agreed and started to help the active cat to look for gold coins.

They looked for gold coins every day and soon they had enough to buy a big house. They lived happily ever after in their big house with all of their gold coins.

The other cat, a black cat named Midnight, was always busy and active. Jasper would often watch as Midnight went out and about, meeting new people and having adventures.

One day, Midnight didn't come home. Jasper waited and waited, but Midnight never came back. Jasper was all alone in the apartment now, and he had to fend for himself. He started to explore the apartment and soon realized that there was a whole world outside that he had never seen before.

Jasper started to venture out, and he soon made friends with the other cats in the neighborhood. He also started to learn about all the different places to explore and the different things to do. He was no longer just a lazy cat who slept all day - he was a busy cat who had a lot of adventures.

One day, Jasper met a cat who was living on the streets. The cat was skinny and dirty, and Jasper could tell that he was very unhappy. Jasper decided to help the cat, and he took him in and cleaned him up. The cat was so grateful, and he soon became Jasper's best friend.
