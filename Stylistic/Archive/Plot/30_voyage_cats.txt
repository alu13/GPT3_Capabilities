The cats of the house were always content to lounge around and nap in the sun. But one day, two of the cats, brothers, decided that they wanted to explore beyond the boundaries of their home. They slipped out when their human wasn't looking and set out on an adventure.

The further they got from home, the more excited they became. They had never seen so many new sights and smells before. They climbed trees and chased birds and ran through fields of tall grass. They even found a stream to play in.

But eventually, night began to fall and the brothers realized they were lost. They had no idea how to get back home. They meowed in frustration, wondering what to do.

Just then, they heard a meow coming from the direction of home. They followed the sound until they saw their sister waiting for them at the edge of the property. She had come looking for them when she realized they were missing.

The three cats were happy to be reunited and vowed never to wander too far from home again. They had learned their lesson and were content to live out their days in the safety of their own backyard.
