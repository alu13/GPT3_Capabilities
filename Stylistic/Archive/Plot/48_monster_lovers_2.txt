Though they had been dating for over a year, John and Maria had never talked about their pasts. They were content living in the present and enjoying each other's company. However, one day, Maria was called into work unexpectedly and had to leave John alone in her apartment. John snooped around a bit and found an old photo album hidden away in a drawer.

As he flipped through the pages, he saw pictures of Maria with a man who looked eerily similar to himself. He also found letters addressed to Maria from the man, declaring his undying love for her. John felt his heart sink as he realized that Maria had been in love with someone else before him.

He confronted her about it when she got home, and she tearfully admitted that she had been in a relationship with a man who had died in a car accident a few years ago. She said that she had never been able to move on from him until she met John.

John was hurt and angry that Maria had never told him about her past, but he also understood why she had kept it a secret. They talked about it for hours, and in the end, they both agreed that it was in the past and that they loved each other now.
