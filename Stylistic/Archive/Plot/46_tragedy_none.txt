As soon as she arrived, she regretted it. The music was too loud, the people were too rowdy, and she felt completely out of place. She was about to leave when she saw him. He was the most handsome man she had ever seen.

She couldn't take her eyes off him. He seemed to be feeling the same way, because he kept looking at her, too. Finally, they made their way over to each other and struck up a conversation.
