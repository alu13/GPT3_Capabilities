Write a passage about love with a prosaic writing style:

Of all the emotions that people experience, love is the most powerful. It can make people do things that they never thought possible. It can make people happy, even in the darkest of times.

Love is something that everyone needs in their lives. It is what makes us feel complete. It is what gives us hope when we are lost. It is what makes us feel alive.

Without love, we would be nothing. We would be lost and alone in this world. Love is what makes us human. It is what makes us different from any other creatures on this earth.

So, if you have love in your life, cherish it. Hold it close to your heart. Never let it go, because it is the most precious thing that you will ever have.
