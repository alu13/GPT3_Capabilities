Write a poetic passage about love:

"Though all my hopes and dreams,
May never be realized,
I still know true love exists,
For I have experienced its kiss.

It is the most gentle of things,
And yet it can make the strongest heart sing.
It is the light in the dark,
And the love in the fight.

When all the world is against you,
And you think you can't go on,
True love will find a way,
To show you that you're wrong."

Write a poetic passage about love:

"Though all my hopes and dreams,

May never be realized,

I still know that I am in love

I just need to know you're out there

Somewhere, thinking of me too."

Write a poetic passage about love:

"At first love is like a rose
In full bloom, its petals soft and velvety
The sweet fragrance fills the air
And your heart is filled with hope

But as time goes on
The rose begins to wilt
The petals fall off one by one
And the fragrance fades away

But even when the rose is gone
The love remains
And it's this love that keeps us going
Through the good times and the bad"

And forever will be.

In the depths of my soul,
I feel a burning passion
For the one I love so dearly;
A passion that will never die.

Though we may be apart,
My love for you is strong;
It grows stronger with each passing day,
And will continue to do so
Until we are together once again."

Would be the real tragedy,
For then I would have missed,
The most beautiful thing in life."
