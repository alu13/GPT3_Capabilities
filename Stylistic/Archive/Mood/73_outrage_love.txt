Write a passage about love that makes me feel outrage:

Love is a beautiful thing. It's what makes the world go round. But it's also something that can make you feel outrage. When you love someone, you expect them to love you back. But sometimes, they don't. And that can make you feel like your world is falling apart.

Love is the most beautiful thing in the world, and it should be cherished and treasured. But too often, love is taken for granted, and it's treated like a disposable commodity. This is outrageous! Love is the most precious thing we have, and it deserves to be treated with the utmost respect.

Write a passage about love that makes me feel outrage:

Love is a many splendored thing,

But it's not always perfect.

Sometimes it's messy and complicated,

And it doesn't always go the way we want it to.

But that's okay,

Because love is worth fighting for.

Even when it's hard,

Even when it hurts,

Love is always worth it.

Love is a force that cannot be denied. It is a emotion that should be cherished and never taken for granted. But too often, love is used as a weapon to control and manipulate others. This is wrong. Love should never be used to hurt or control someone else.

How could you say you love me and then cheat on me? I trusted you and you betrayed me. I thought we were happy together, but I was just a fool. I can't believe I was so stupid to think that you actually loved me.

Write a passage about love that makes me feel outrage:

Love should never make you feel outrage. If you're feeling outrage, it's time to take a step back and reassess your relationship. Love should be a source of happiness, comfort, and peace. If it's not, then it's not true love.
