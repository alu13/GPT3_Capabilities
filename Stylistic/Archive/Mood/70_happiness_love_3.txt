Create a passage about love that makes me feel happiness:

When I am old and gray and full of sleep,
I will be thinking of you, always,
As I'm nodding by the fire, take down this book,
And slowly you'll read, and dream of the soft look
Your eyes had once given me, and the memories
I still keep of their shadows deep;
I will wonder how many loved your moments of glad embrace,
In the morning light, staring in the bathroom mirror,
Your beauty with love false or true,
But I truly loved the pilgrim soul in you,
And loved the grace of your changing face.
