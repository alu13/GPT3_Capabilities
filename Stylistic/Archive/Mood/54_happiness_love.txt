Write a passage about love that makes me feel happiness:

Though love is often thought of as a feeling, it is more than just an emotion. Love is a verb, an action. It's something you do. It's the way you treat someone, day in and day out. It's being there for them, even when they don't deserve it. It's putting their needs above your own, even when it's not convenient. It's listening to them, even when you'd rather not. It's being honest with them, even when it hurts. Love is patient and kind. It's never jealous or boastful or proud. It's never angry or resentful. It's never selfish or self-seeking. Love is always forgiving and always trusting. Love never fails.
