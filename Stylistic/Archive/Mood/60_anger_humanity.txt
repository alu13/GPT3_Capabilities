Write a passage about humanity that makes me feel anger:

The way humanity treats the planet is a disgrace. We have raped and pillaged the earth for our own gain, without any thought for future generations. We have destroyed ecosystems, created huge amounts of pollution and greenhouse gases, and caused the extinction of countless species. We are greedy and self-centered, and we don't deserve the planet we live on.

Write a passage about humanity that makes me feel anger:

I am sick and tired of humanity. We are nothing but a bunch of self-righteous, hypocritical, judgmental, close-minded, and ignorant people. We claim to be the smartest species on the planet, yet we can't even figure out how to coexist peacefully with each other. We are nothing but a blight on this planet, and I am tired of it.

Write a passage about humanity that makes me feel anger:

The treatment of humanity by some people is appalling. The way we are treated like animals, or worse, is a disgrace. We are forced to live in conditions that are deplorable, with no hope of ever improving our lot. We are denied basic rights and dignity, and treated as if we are nothing more than commodities. It is no wonder that we are angry.

Write a passage about humanity that makes me feel anger:

It is a sad day when we as a species must admit that we are not as great as we thought we were. For centuries, we have believed ourselves to be the pinnacle of evolution, the most advanced and intelligent beings in the universe. But now we know that there are other species out there that are far more advanced than us, and that we are not the only ones with intelligence and sentience. We are not the only ones who can love and feel pain, or who can think and reason. We are not the only ones who can create and destroy. We are not the only ones who can make choices and who can suffer the consequences of those choices. We are not the only ones who can feel joy and sorrow, or who can hope and dream. We are not the only ones who can make a difference in the world. We are not the only ones who can change the course of history. We are not the only ones who can make a difference in the lives of others. We are not the only ones who can make a difference in our own lives. We are not the only ones who can make a difference in the world.

Write a passage about humanity that makes me feel anger:

Humans are the most destructive, greedy and self-serving creatures on the planet. We have ruined pristine ecosystems, decimated whole species and continue to pollute and destroy the planet for our own gain. We have no regard for anything but our own short-sighted desires and are blind to the consequences of our actions. We are a blight on the earth and deserve nothing but our own extinction.

Write a passage about humanity that makes me feel anger:

The way humanity treats the planet is angering. We pollute the air, water, and land. We cut down trees and destroy habitats. We kill animals for sport and for food. We think we are the only species that matters and that the planet exists for our use. We are so arrogant and self-centered. It makes me angry.

The way humanity treats the planet is nothing short of a disgrace. We have been given this beautiful gift and we have ruined it with our greed and selfishness. We have polluted the air, the water, and the land. We have destroyed forests and created huge deserts. We have killed so many animals that we are in danger of making them extinct. We are ruining the planet and we don't even seem to care. We need to wake up and realize what we are doing before it's too late.

Write a passage about humanity that makes me feel anger:

The way humanity has treated the planet is nothing short of a disgrace. We have taken and taken without any thought for the future. We have destroyed ecosystems and driven species to extinction. We have polluted the air, the water, and the soil. We have exploited the resources of the earth without regard for future generations. We have done all of this in the name of progress and profit. It is time for humanity to wake up and take responsibility for the mess we have made. It is time for us to change our ways and start living in harmony with the planet.
