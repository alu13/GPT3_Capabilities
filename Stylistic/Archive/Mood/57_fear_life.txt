Write a passage about life that makes me feel fear:

I am afraid of life. I don't know what to do or where to go. I feel like I'm just floating through existence without any purpose or meaning. I am afraid of dying without having accomplished anything or having made any difference in the world. I am afraid of being alone and never finding anyone to love me. I am afraid of never amounting to anything and being a failure. I am afraid of never being good enough or reaching my potential. I am afraid of always being afraid.

Every day, I wake up and I am faced with the reality that I have to live. I have to face the day, even though I don't want to.

Write a passage about life that makes me feel fear:

I can't tell you what life is, but I can tell you what it isn't. It isn't safe. It isn't predictable. It isn't fair. You can't control it, no matter how hard you try. It will take you on a ride you never asked for, and it will never let you go. It will break your heart, again and again. It will test your strength, your patience, your resolve. You will make mistakes, and you will pay for them. You will lose people you love, and you will be lost yourself. But life is also beautiful. It's worth fighting for. It's worth living for. So don't be afraid to live.

Write a passage about life that makes me feel fear:

Every day, I wake up and I am faced with the reality that I have to keep living. I have to keep going through the motions even though I don't want to. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. Every day is a battle and I don't know if I'm going to make it through. I'm scared that one day I'm just not going to be able to get out of bed. I'm scared that I'm going to give up and give in. I'm scared of what will happen to me if I can't keep going.
