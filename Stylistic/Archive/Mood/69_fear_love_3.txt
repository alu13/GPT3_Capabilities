Create a passage about love that makes me feel fear:

Love is something that should be cherished and never taken for granted. It's the most powerful emotion that we as humans can experience. But love can also be dangerous. It can make us do things that we never thought possible. It can make us act irrationally and do things that we later regret. Love can make us blind to the truth and to the reality of the situation. We can become so consumed by our love for someone that we can't see anything else. And that can be dangerous.

Love is one of the most powerful emotions we as humans can experience. It can make us feel elated and on top of the world, or it can completely consume us and leave us feeling vulnerable and exposed. Love is passionate and intense, and can sometimes be overwhelming. It can be all-consuming and leave us feeling out of control. For some, this feeling of being out of control is exhilarating, but for others, it can be scary and even dangerous.
