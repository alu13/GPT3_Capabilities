Write a passage about love that makes me feel sadness:

Though love is often thought of as a happy emotion, it can also bring great sadness. This is because love is often unrequited, meaning we can love someone who does not love us back. This can lead to feelings of rejection, loneliness, and heartache. Additionally, even when love is reciprocated, it can still be a source of sadness. This is because love often means having to say goodbye to someone we care deeply for, whether it be due to distance, death, or simply moving on. Therefore, love is not always a happy emotion, but it is one that we often cannot help but feel.
