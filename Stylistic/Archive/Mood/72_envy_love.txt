When I see you with her, I can't help but feel a pang of envy. I know I shouldn't, but I can't help it. I wish I was the one you were with, the one you loved.

Write a passage about love that makes me feel envy:

When I see you with her, I can't help but feel a pang of envy. I know I shouldn't, but I can't help it. I can't help but wonder what it would be like to be the one you love. To be the one who makes you laugh, who you confide in, who you want to be with. It hurts to see you with her, but I know that I can't have you. I know that you're not mine. But that doesn't stop me from wanting you.

Write a passage about love that makes me feel envy:

Love is amazing. It's something that can make you feel happy, content, and complete. It's something that can give you butterflies, make your heart race, and make you feel like you're on top of the world. It's something that can make you feel like you're floating on a cloud. It's something that can make you feel invincible. It's something that can make you feel like nothing can bring you down.

When I see couples in love, I can't help but feel a twinge of envy. I want what they have. I want to be able to experience those same amazing feelings. I want to be loved and to be in love. It looks like such a beautiful thing, and I can't help but want it for myself.

Write a passage about love that makes me feel envy:

Though I am happy in my current relationship, I can't help but feel a twinge of envy when I see others in love. There's something about the way they look at each other, like they can't believe their good fortune, that makes me long for that same feeling. I know it's silly to be jealous of something I haven't experienced, but I can't help it. I want what they have.

Write a passage about love that makes me feel envy:

When I see couples in love, I can't help but feel a twinge of envy. I see the way they look at each other, the way they touch each other gently, and I know that they have something special that I will never have. I see the way they laugh together, the way they finish each other's sentences, and I know that they have a bond that I will never share. I see the way they are together, and I can't help but feel a little bit jealous.
