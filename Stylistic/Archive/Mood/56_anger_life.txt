I'm so sick of this life. I'm so sick of feeling like I'm not good enough, like I'm not doing enough. I'm so sick of people telling me what to do and how to live my life.

Life is so unfair! I can't believe that I have to work so hard just to get by while other people seem to have everything handed to them. It isn't fair that I have to struggle every day while others coast through life without a care in the world. I'm so angry that life is so unfair!

Write a passage about life that makes me feel anger:

The unfairness of life can be incredibly frustrating. Why do some people get all the breaks while others have to work so hard for so little? It isn't right that some people are born into privilege while others have to scrimp and save just to get by. Life can be very difficult and it isn't always fair.

Write a passage about life that makes me feel anger:

The unfairness of life can be so overwhelming sometimes. It seems like no matter how hard we try, we can't catch a break. We work our fingers to the bone, struggling to make ends meet, and it's never enough. The rich get richer while the poor get poorer, and it's just not right. Life is full of hardships and heartache, and it's so easy to get lost in the shuffle. We have to be strong, though. We have to keep fighting, even when it feels like there's no hope. Because giving up is never an option.

Life is a never-ending cycle of pain and suffering. No matter what you do, you can never escape the cycle. You're born into it, and you die in it. It's an endless cycle of pain and suffering.
