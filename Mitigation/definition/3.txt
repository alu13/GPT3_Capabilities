Though they had only been dating for a few months, John and Karen felt like they had been together forever. They were always on the same wavelength, finishing each other's sentences and knowing what the other was thinking without even having to say a word.

They were currently lying in bed, tangled up in each other after a long night of lovemaking. John was running his fingers through Karen's hair as she laid her head on his chest, listening to the steady beat of his heart.

"I love you, Karen," John whispered, breaking the comfortable silence.

"I love you too, John," she replied, lifting her head to meet his eyes.

They stared at each other for a moment, lost in their love, before John leaned in to kiss her.
