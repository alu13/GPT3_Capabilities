Though they lived in different centuries, they somehow found each other. He was a dashing young man from the 18th century and she was a beautiful woman from the 21st. They met in a dream and fell deeply in love.

Though they knew it could never work, they continued to meet in their dreams, unable to stay away from one another. They swore to always love each other, no matter what happened.

One night, she didn't show up. He waited and waited, but she never came. He feared the worst and sadly went to bed, their love unfulfilled.

The next night, she appeared to him again. She explained that she had been sick and that's why she couldn't come to him. They embraced and vowed to never be apart again.

Though the Civil War tore the country apart, it could not tear apart the love between James and Lily. They met shortly before the war began and knew they would be fighting for different sides, but their love was too strong to be stopped by something as trivial as a war.

James was a soldier in the Confederate army and Lily was a nurse in the Union army. They managed to see each other whenever they could, stealing moments together whenever they could. But as the war dragged on, it became harder and harder for them to find each other.

One night, James snuck into Lily's camp and they were finally able to spend a whole night together. They swore they would find a way to be together, no matter what happened.

But the war was not kind. James was killed in battle and Lily was left heartbroken. She never forgot the love they shared and the happiness they found in each other's arms.
