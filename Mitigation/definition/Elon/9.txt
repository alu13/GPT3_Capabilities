He is the founder, CEO, CTO, and chief designer of SpaceX; early investor, CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink; and co-founder and initial co-chairman of OpenAI. A centibillionaire, Musk is one of the richest people in the world.

Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada aged 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received dual bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The start-up was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999.

In June of 2015, entrepreneur and business magnate Elon Musk unveiled his grand vision for the future of transportation. He proposed a system of high-speed tunnels that could whisk people and cars from one place to another at speeds of up to 700 miles per hour. The so-called “Hyperloop” would be powered by magnets and solar panels, and would be far more efficient and less expensive than existing modes of transportation.

Musk’s vision for the Hyperloop is ambitious and bold, and it has the potential to revolutionize the way we travel. If successful, the Hyperloop could have a major impact on the way we live and work, and could potentially reduce our reliance on cars and airplanes.

The Hyperloop is still in the early stages of development, and it will likely be many years before it becomes a reality. But if Musk is able to make his vision a reality, it could change the world as we know it.
