Love is like a roller coaster, it has its ups and downs, but in the end you always end up puking your guts out.

At least that's what I've heard. I've never actually been on a roller coaster, or in love for that matter, but I imagine it's pretty similar. You have the highs of feeling like you're on top of the world, and the lows of feeling like you're going to puke your guts out. But in the end, you always end up puking your guts out.

Love is a many splendored thing. You can love your family, your friends, your country, your favorite sports team, or even your favorite food. But the one thing you should never love is your alarm clock. That thing is nothing but pure evil.

Love is like a fart. You never know who’s going to like it or not. But if you keep it to yourself, it just becomes more and more stinky.

I asked my crush out and they said yes! I’m so excited, I can’t wait to meet up with them and stare into their beautiful eyes. I wonder what our future together will be like? I hope they’re the one, I don’t want to go through the dating process again.

Love is like a fart. If you have to force it, it’s probably not worth it.

Love is a many splendored thing. It's also a pain in the neck, the butt, and sometimes even the heart. But despite all the heartache and pain, love is still worth it. After all, what would life be without love? A big, fat, boring mess, that's what.

Love is blind, but marriage is an eye-opener.

After years of being together, you finally get to see your partner's true colors. The good, the bad, and the ugly. And sometimes you wonder, "How did I ever fall in love with this person?"

But then you remember all the good times you've had together, and you know that love is worth the fight.

Love is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re going to get. Sometimes you get the good stuff, like truffles and caramel. Other times you get the cheap, filler chocolate that nobody likes. But you keep eating it because you’re hoping the next one will be better.

Love is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re going to get. Unless you’re one of those people who always gets the chocolate with the nuts, in which case, you know exactly what you’re going to get. And it’s going to be nuts.
