They had been through so much together. The highs and lows, the good times and the bad. They had seen it all and come out the other side stronger for it. 

Now, they were standing on the edge of a precipice, looking down at the raging river below. They knew what they had to do.

They had been lovers for years, but it was always a secret. They met in secret, away from the prying eyes of their families. They snuck kisses and stolen moments whenever they could. 

But now they were finally going to be together openly. They had planned everything out perfectly. They would run away together and start a new life, far away from judgmental eyes. 

They met up on the night of their escape, hearts pounding with excitement. They couldn't wait to be together finally. They embraced each other tightly, vowing never to let go. 

But just as they were about to leave, they were caught. Their families had found out and were there to stop them. They were dragged kicking and screaming back to their separate homes. 

Their love was never meant to be. But they would never forget the moments they shared, or the passion that burned between them.
