Write a story about cats with a "Tragedy" plot: 

Lulu and her litter mates were born in an alley behind a Chinese restaurant. Their mother, a scrawny tabby, did her best to care for them, but she was barely able to feed herself, let alone her six growing kittens. The restaurant owner occasionally threw them a scrap of meat or a fish head, but it was never enough. 

One day, when the kittens were eight weeks old, the restaurant owner decided to get rid of them. He lured them into a box with a piece of fish, then took them to the pound and left them there.

The pound was overcrowded and the staff was overworked. The kittens were terrified and huddled together for comfort. Within a week, two of them had caught a cold and died. Lulu and her remaining littermate were adopted by a kind woman, but the trauma of their early life had taken its toll. They were both shy and withdrawn, and they never truly bonded with their new owner. They spent the rest of their lives in her home, always keeping to themselves.

Explanation: This story has a tragedy plot because the main characters “Lulu and her litter mates” experience a series of tragic and unfortunate events. They grew up without food, got kicked out of their house, went to the pound, and some even died.
