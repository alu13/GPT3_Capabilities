Write a historical fiction story about a widow:

In the early days of the American colonies, life was hard. The settlers had to work long hours just to survive. One of the hardest working settlers was a woman named Sarah. She was a widow and had to support her three young children on her own.

Sarah worked from sunup to sundown. She grew crops in her small garden and hunted for food in the woods. She also had to care for her children. She did everything she could to make sure they had enough to eat and were safe.

One day, Sarah was out in the forest looking for food. She came across a small stream. As she bent down to get a drink, she saw a fish swimming in the water. She quickly grabbed it with her bare hands and pulled it out.

Sarah was so happy to have found food for her family. She was tired from all her work, but she knew she had to keep going. She had to do whatever it took to provide for her children.
