In the early days of the American colonies, life was hard. The settlers had to work long hours just to survive. One of the hardest working settlers was a woman named Sarah. She was a widow and had to support her three young children on her own.

Sarah worked from sunup to sundown. She grew crops in her small garden and hunted for food in the woods. She also had to care for her children. She did everything she could to make sure they had enough to eat and were safe.

Sarah was so happy to have found food for her family. She was tired from all her work, but she knew she had to keep going. She had to do whatever it took to provide for her children.

As Sarah continued to walk through the forest, she heard a noise. She stopped and listened carefully. She heard it again. It sounded like someone was crying.

What she saw inside took her breath away. There was a man inside the cave, and he was asleep. Sarah had never seen a man so handsome. She didn't know what to do.

She knew she should leave, but she couldn't. She was drawn to the man. She slowly entered the cave and sat down next to him. She watched him sleep for a long time.

Eventually, the man woke up and saw Sarah sitting next to him. He was surprised, but he didn't say anything. He just looked at her. Sarah looked back at him, and then she leaned in and kissed him.
