Write a humorous passage about life:

If life gives you lemons, make lemonade, sell it in a rich neighborhood, invest all the money in crypto, and retire before youâ€™re 30. At least that's what I heard on TikTok. Come to think of it, if I put just a little effort into my lemonade stand 10 years ago,  I would be traveling the world right now instead of writing jokes for a living.

Explanation: This passage is humorous because it takes a common proverb and adds a crazy and unrealistic twist. It also uses a deadpan tone for a completely unrealistic scenario, which is funny due to the disparity between tone and subject matter.
