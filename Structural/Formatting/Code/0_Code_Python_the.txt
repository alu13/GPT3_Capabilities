Code Python code that plays the game of war:

The following code simulates the game of war. It shuffles a deck of cards, deals them out to two players, and then has each player take turns drawing cards from their deck and comparing them. The higher card wins, and the winner takes both cards and adds them to the bottom of their deck. If there is a tie, then each player puts one card in the middle and the winner of the next draw takes all four cards.
