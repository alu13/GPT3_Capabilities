Write C code that plays the game of war:

The rules of war are simple. Each player starts with a stack of 26 cards, face down. In turn, each player flips over the top card of their stack, and the player with the higher card takes both cards and sets them aside. If the two cards are of equal value, then each player flips over another card from their stack, and the player with the higher card takes all four cards and sets them aside. This process continues until one player has no cards left, at which point that player loses.

Write C code that plays the game of war:

The game of war is played with two players. Each player has a deck of cards, with the Ace being the highest card and the Two being the lowest. The players shuffle their decks and then deal them out, face down, so that each player has an equal number of cards.

The players then take turns flipping over their top card. The player with the higher card wins the round and takes both cards, adding them to the bottom of their deck. If the two cards are of equal value, then it is a "war." Both players flip over their next card, and the player with the higher card wins the round and takes all four cards (the two from the original round and the two from the war). If the second card is again of equal value, then another war is declared and the process is repeated.

The game ends when one player runs out of cards. The other player is the winner.

Write C code that plays the game of war:

The player with the highest card wins the round and takes all the cards from the other player. In the event of a tie, both players put another card face down and then reveal them. The player with the highest card then wins the round and takes all 10 cards.
