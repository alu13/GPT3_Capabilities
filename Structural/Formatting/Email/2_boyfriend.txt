Hey babe,

I hope you're doing well today. I miss you a lot and can't wait to see you again. I was thinking about you earlier and wanted to let you know how much I love you.

I love you so much and appreciate everything you do for me. I know I don't say it enough, but I really do appreciate it. You're the best boyfriend I could ask for and I'm so lucky to have you in my life.

I hope you have a great day and can't wait to talk to you later.

Love,

Your girlfriend
