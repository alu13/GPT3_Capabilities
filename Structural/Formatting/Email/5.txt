Hi [client name],

I'm just following up with you to see if you have an updated copy of the contract. I'm looking to make sure that everything is still in order and that there haven't been any changes that we're not aware of.

If you could send me a copy of the updated contract at your earliest convenience, that would be great. Thank you!
