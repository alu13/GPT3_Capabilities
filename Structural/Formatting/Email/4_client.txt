Hi there,

Thank you so much for choosing me as your photographer! I am so excited to work with you and capture your special day.

I wanted to touch base with you and go over a few things before the big day. First, I wanted to let you know that I will be arriving early to get set up and take some candid shots of you and your guests as they arrive. I will also be taking some shots of the venue before the ceremony starts.

I will be taking a mix of posed and candid shots throughout the day, and I will also be sure to get plenty of shots of the details (like your dress, flowers, etc.) that you have worked so hard on.

I will be delivering the edited photos to you electronically within 4-6 weeks after the wedding. I hope that timeline works for you.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to let me know. I am looking forward to working with you and capture your beautiful day!
