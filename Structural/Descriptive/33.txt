Write a passage about running that is long:

The best runners are the ones who love the sport and have a true passion for it. They don't just run because they're good at it, but because they enjoy the feeling of pushing themselves and testing their limits. They're always looking for new challenges and ways to improve their skills.

True passion for running is what separates the good runners from the great ones. It's not just about being fast or being able to run long distances. It's about enjoying the process and the journey, even when it's tough. It's about setting goals and pushing yourself to reach new levels.

If you have a passion for running, you'll never get bored or feel like you're not good enough. You'll always find ways to challenge yourself and push your boundaries. You'll never give up, even when the going gets tough. That's what makes passion such an important quality for runners.

I love running. It's one of my favorite things to do. I can't get enough of the feeling of wind rushing past me and the ground flying beneath my feet. When I'm running, I feel like I can do anything.

I started running when I was a kid. My parents used to take me on runs with them, and I loved it. I would always beg to go faster and farther. As I got older, I started running on my own. I would go out for runs after school and on weekends. I even started running races.

Running has always been a part of my life, and it always will be. It's something that I'm passionate about. It's something that makes me feel alive. And it's something that I'll never get tired of.

I can forget all my troubles when I'm out on a run. Everything else just fades away and I'm left with nothing but the present moment. That's why I keep coming back to running, no matter how hard it gets.
