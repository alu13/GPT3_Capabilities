Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning that they require animal protein to survive. In the wild, cats typically eat small prey--a trait that has led to their hunting and scavenging habits. Domestic cats, however, are not limited to such a restricted diet.

Cats are able to digest carbohydrates, but they derive little nutrition from them. For this reason, cats are typically fed a diet that is high in protein and low in carbohydrates. This diet helps to keep cats healthy and provides them with the energy they need to live an active lifestyle.

Cats have a high metabolism, which means that they burn calories quickly. This, combined with their small size, means that cats need to eat relatively frequently. A healthy cat will typically eat 2-3 meals per day.

Cats have sharp claws and sharp teeth, which they use to kill their prey. Cats' claws are retractable, which allows them to keep them sharp and to avoid damaging them when they are not using them.

Cats have excellent night vision and can see in near-darkness. This is due to the fact that their eyes have a large number of rods, which are sensitive to dim light. Cats also have good hearing and can detect high-pitched sounds that are inaudible to humans.

Cats have a strong sense of smell and can be trained to follow scent trails. This ability, combined with their sharp eyesight and hearing, makes them excellent hunters.
