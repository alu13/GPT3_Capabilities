Write a brief passage about love:

Though love is often thought of as a feeling, it is much more than that. Love is an action, a verb. It is something you do. You can love someone by taking care of them, listening to them, being there for them, and showing them your support. Love is something you put your time and effort into. It is not just a feeling, but a decision. A decision to love someone, no matter what.
