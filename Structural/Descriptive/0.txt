Write a short passage about love:

There is no single definition of love, because it is such a complex emotion. In general, though, love is considered to be a strong, passionate emotion that is usually associated with a feeling of strong affection. Love is often described as a feeling of strong affection and strong passion in a relationship. It is often said that love is blind, meaning that people in love often do not see the faults of the person they are in love with.
