It can also help to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Running is a weight-bearing exercise, which means it helps to strengthen the bones and muscles.\n\nThere are many benefits to running, but it\u2019s important to start slowly and build up gradually. If you\u2019re new to running, it\u2019s a good idea to start with a walk-run program. This means alternating between walking and running for a set period of time. For example, you might walk for two minutes and then run for one minute.\n\nAs you become more fit, you can gradually increase the amount of time you spend running and decrease the amount of time you spend walking.

It can involve walking or slow jogging for a few minutes.\n\nCooling down after running is also important. It helps to gradually slow your heart rate and breathing.
