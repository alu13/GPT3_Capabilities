Write three paragraphs about birds:

Birds are a type of vertebrate animal distinguished by the possession of feathers, wings, and the power of flight. Birds are the only remaining group of reptiles with this capability. Flight enables birds to move between locations rapidly and to avoid predators. It also allows them to escape from harsh weather conditions. Birds use their beaks and feet to gather food, build nests, and care for their young.

There are more than 10,000 species of birds, which are divided into two main groups: the Old World birds, which are found in Europe, Asia, and Africa; and the New World birds, which are found in North and South America. Birds range in size from the tiny hummingbird to the large ostrich.

Birds are generally active during the day and sleep at night. Some birds, such as owls, are nocturnal. Birds are social creatures and live in flocks. They communicate with one another using a variety of vocalizations, including songs. Birds are an important part of the ecosystem, as they help to control insect populations and disperse seeds.
