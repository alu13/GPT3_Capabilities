It is a low-impact activity that can be performed anywhere, making it a convenient workout option. When running, your bodyweight is supported by your legs, making it a relatively safe activity. Additionally, running is an efficient way to burn calories and can help you lose weight.\n\nTo get started, all you need is a pair of comfortable shoes and some open space. Start by walking at a moderate pace for a few minutes to warm up your muscles. Then, begin running at a comfortable pace. You can gradually increase your speed as you get more comfortable. If you start to feel tired, slow down and take a break. Remember to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water before, during, and after your run.",
