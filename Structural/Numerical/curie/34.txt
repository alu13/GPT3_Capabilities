Write a passage with ten paragraphs about Shanghai:

Shanghai, China is a huge city with a long and rich history. It is a major commercial center and one of the world's most populous cities. It is located on the East China Sea, on the southern edge of the Yangtze River Delta.

Shanghai was founded in the late 18th century by the British as a treaty port. It rapidly became a commercial center, and by the mid-19th century it had become one of the most important cities in China. The city's rapid growth was due in part to its position as the center of the opium trade, and to the development of the steamship and railroad systems.

During World War II, Shanghai was the main base of operations for the Chinese Nationalist Army. After the war, Shanghai became the center of the Chinese economy, and it has remained one of the country's most important cities.

Today, Shanghai is a major center of commerce and culture. It is home to many of the country's leading universities, and it is the seat of the Chinese government. Shanghai is a well-developed city, with a rich and varied history.
