Write a passage with five paragraphs about Shanghai:

Shanghai is one of the four direct-controlled municipalities of China and the most populous city proper in the world, with a population of more than 24 million as of 2014. It is a global financial center, and a transport hub with the world's busiest container port. Located in the Yangtze River Delta in East China, Shanghai sits on the south edge of the mouth of the Yangtze in the middle portion of the Chinese coast. The municipality borders the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the north, south and west, and is bounded to the east by the East China Sea.

The city was one of five treaty ports forced open to foreign trade following the British victory over China in the First Opium War. The subsequent 1842 Treaty of Nanking and 1844 Treaty of Whampoa allowed the establishment of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. The city then flourished as a center of commerce between Asia and the West, and became the primary financial hub of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s. During the World War II, the city was the site of the major Battle of Shanghai. After the war, with the Communist Party takeover of the mainland in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries, and the city's global influence declined. In the 1990s, the economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping resulted in an intense re-development of the city, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment to the city.

Shanghai's status as a global city has attracted a large number of migrants from across China and other parts of the world. The 2010 census recorded more than 24 million people with 143 nationalities living in the city, making it the largest concentration of ethnic Chinese outside of China. Shanghai is a popular tourist destination, renowned for its historic landmarks such as the Bund, City God Temple and Yu Garden, as well as the extensive Pudong skyline, particularly the Oriental Pearl Tower.

Shanghai has been described as the "showpiece" of the booming economy of mainland China. A leading global city, Shanghai exerts influence over global commerce, finance, culture, art, fashion, research and entertainment. It has been described as the "Basketball City" for its obsession with the sport, and is also considered a fashion capital of the world. The city hosted the 2010 Shanghai Expo, one of the largest international expositions in history.
