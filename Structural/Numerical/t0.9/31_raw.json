            "text": "Write a paragraph with ten sentences about Shanghai:\n\nShanghai, on the east coast of China, is the country's biggest city and a global financial hub. Its heart is the Bund, a famed waterfront promenade lined with colonial-era buildings. Across the Huangpu River rises the Pudong district's futuristic skyline, including 632m Shanghai Tower and the Oriental Pearl TV Tower, with distinctive pink spheres. Sprawling Shanghai Disneyland Resort features an enormous castle.\n\nIn the 1930s, Shanghai was China's most cosmopolitan city and a hotbed of intellectual and artistic activity. European style architecture abounded in the International Settlement, while Chinese temples, pagodas and shikumen neighborhoods were found in the French Concession. Today's Nanjing Road is the city's main shopping street and the Bund is a popular tourist destination.\n\nShanghai's history dates back to the 4th century BC, when it was a part of the State of Chu. In the 3rd century BC it became an independent county town. In AD 274 it was captured by the Kingdom of Wei, and after the fall of the Wei Dynasty in 280 it came under the rule of the Jin Dynasty. In 311 the Sui Dynasty took control of the area and in 589 it became a part of the Tang Dynasty.\n\nThe Song Dynasty (960-1279) made Shanghai a county town and in 1291 it became a part of the Yuan Dynasty. In the 14th century, Shanghai became a part of the Ming Dynasty.\n\nIn the 19th century, Shanghai was the largest city in the Far East and the main port for trade with the west. It was also a renowned center of finance and a cosmopolitan melting pot.\n\nThe 20th century brought profound changes to Shanghai. In 1949 the Communist Party took control of the city and the following year the People's Republic of China was established. Shanghai then underwent a period of rapid modernization and industrialization.\n\nToday, Shanghai is a booming metropolis with a skyline that rivals any in the world. It is a city of contradictions, where old and new, east and west, collide and coexist. It is a place of opportunity, where anything is possible.",
