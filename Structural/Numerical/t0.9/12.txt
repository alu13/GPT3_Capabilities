When we love, we put the needs of others before our own. We think of their happiness and well-being before our own. Love is selfless. Love is also sacrificial. We are willing to give up our time, energy, and resources for the sake of another person.

Love is also patient and kind. It is not jealous or boastful. It is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way. It is not irritable or resentful. Love is not glad about wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.

Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends.
