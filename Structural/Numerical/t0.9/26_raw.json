Running is a means of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. It is simply defined in athletics terms as a gait in which at regular points during the running cycle both feet are off the ground.

This phase is followed by a recovery phase in which all feet are on the ground. The term \"running\" can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from a slow jog to a sprint.

Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas.\n\nThe sport of running has multiple disciplines, or ways of running. Track running is running around a track, often inside a stadium, and field running is running on any other surface. Road running takes place on pavement and is the most common form of running. Cross country running is running over terrain which is not normally found on a track or a road. Trail running is similar to cross country running but is often run on dirt paths or trails.\nRunning is often perceived as a low-impact sport, however, forces up to three times the runner's body weight are exerted with each foot strike. Good running form consists of striking the ground with the forefoot, not the heel, keeping the body upright and using the arms for balance. The arms should be bent at the elbow and swung in a rhythm opposite to that of the legs.\n\nWhile running, it is important to breathe in rhythm with your foot strikes. Inhale for three strides and exhale for two. This will help you maintain a consistent pace and prevent yourself from getting too winded. It is also important to stay hydrated, especially if you are running in hot weather. Be sure to drink plenty of water before, during, and after your run.\n\nIf you are just starting out, it is important to ease into running slowly and build up your endurance over time. Start by walking for a few minutes, then slowly begin to add in short bursts of running. Once you are able to run for 30 minutes without stopping, you can start to increase your speed and distance. Join a local running club or find a running partner to help you stay motivated.\n\nRunning is a great way to get in shape and improve your overall health. It is important to listen to your body, though, and to not push yourself too hard. If you experience any pain or discomfort, slow down or stop running and consult a doctor. With regular practice, you can become a faster, stronger, and more efficient runner.",
