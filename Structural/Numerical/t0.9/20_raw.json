But when I started college, I decided that I needed to get in shape. So, I started slowly by running a mile a day. It was tough at first, but I kept at it. Eventually, I was running three miles a day and loving it.\n\nNow, running is a huge part of my life. I try to run at least four times a week, and I race regularly. I\u2019ve even done a few half-marathons. I\u2019ve found that running helps me to clear my head and to stay in shape. It\u2019s also a great way to meet new people.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re thinking about starting to run, just go for it. Start slowly and build up your mileage. You might just find that you love it as much as I do.",

I would get so out of breath and my legs would feel like they were on fire. But then I started to see all of the benefits that running has and I decided to give it another try.\n\nNow, I run three to four times a week and I feel amazing. I have so much energy and I\u2019m never out of breath anymore. My legs are strong and I just feel overall healthier.\n\nI\u2019ve also found that running is a great way to clear my head. When I\u2019m out on a run, I don\u2019t have to think about anything else except for putting one foot in front of the other. It\u2019s a great way to de-stress and just relax.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re thinking about starting to run, or if you\u2019ve been running for a while but you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re doing it right, here are some tips.\n\nFirst, start slow. If you\u2019ve never ran before, you don\u2019t want to go out and try to run a marathon. Start with a short run, like a few blocks, and work your way up.\n\nSecond, make sure you have the right gear. You don\u2019t need the most expensive shoes or the latest gadgets, but you do need to make sure you have a good pair of shoes that fit well and support your feet.\n\nThird, find a route that you enjoy. If you\u2019re running in a place that you don\u2019t enjoy, you\u2019re not going to want to do it. But if you find a route that you love, you\u2019ll look forward to your runs.\n\nFourth, don\u2019t be afraid to mix it up. If you get bored of running the same route every day, mix it up and try a new route. Or, if you\u2019re running indoors on a treadmill, try running outdoors.\n\nFinally, don\u2019t forget to cool down and stretch when you\u2019re done. This will help your muscles recover and prevent injuries.\n\nSo, there you have it. These are just a few tips to help you get started with running. Remember to start slow, find a route you enjoy, and mix it up to keep things interesting. And most importantly, don\u2019t forget to cool down and stretch when you\u2019re done.",

As a child, running was a way to explore my neighborhood and the world beyond. I would run for miles, until I was exhausted and my parents would have to call me home.
