As one of the four direct-controlled municipalities of China, it serves as the financial, cultural, and economic hub of the country.\n\nShanghai has a long history dating back over 1,000 years. It was a small fishing village during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD) but grew in importance during the Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD) when it became a major port city. In the 19th century, Shanghai became a treaty port following the First Opium War (1839-1842) and subsequent treaties. This led to an influx of foreign trade and investment, and the city became a cosmopolitan metropolis.\n\nShanghai underwent a rapid economic development in the early 20th century, and by 1927 it was the largest city in the Far East. However, the city was occupied by the Japanese in 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), and thereafter went into decline. After the war, the city was rebuilt and regained its status as a major metropolis in the late 20th century.\n\nToday, Shanghai is a global financial center and one of the most populous cities in the world. The city is home to a number of major multinational companies and banks, as well as numerous Chinese companies. The skyline of Shanghai is dotted with skyscrapers, and the city is a major tourist destination.",
