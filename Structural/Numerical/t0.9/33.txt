Shanghai, China’s largest city, is situated on the Yangtze River Delta on the country’s east coast.

Shanghai’s history dates back to the 11th century, when it was founded as a fishing village. It later became a major trading port and was one of the treaty ports opened to foreign trade in the 19th century. Shanghai’s growth was spurred by the construction of the Suzhou Creek tunnels, which provided a direct link between the Yangtze River and the city’s port.

In the early 20th century, Shanghai was the site of anti-foreigner violence and a major center of the Chinese nationalist movement. The city later fell to the Japanese in the Second World War and was occupied until the end of the conflict. Following the war, Shanghai was returned to Chinese control and became a major industrial center.

Since the economic reforms of the 1980s, Shanghai has once again emerged as a major economic hub. The city has been at the forefront of China’s economic development, and its rise as a global financial center has led to the development of a number of new skyscrapers in its skyline.

Write a passage with five paragraphs about Shanghai:

In the 1930s, Shanghai was the most cosmopolitan city in the East. It was a melting pot of cultures, a place where East met West and where people from all over the world came to seek their fortune.

The city was a hive of activity, with skyscrapers and busy streets, and its nightlife was legendary. Shanghai was also a dangerous place, with gangs and gangsters fighting for control of the city.

The Japanese occupation of Shanghai in the 1940s brought an end to the cosmopolitan city. The Japanese were brutal occupiers, and the people of Shanghai suffered greatly under their rule.

After the war, Shanghai slowly began to rebuild. The city regained its status as a major financial center, and its skyline once again began to fill with skyscrapers.
