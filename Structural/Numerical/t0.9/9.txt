There is no one definitive definition of love. Love can be expressed in many ways and takes on different meanings depending on the person. For some, love is a feeling of strong affection and requires intimate connection with another. Others may see love as more of an action, such as continually making an effort to improve the relationship. Love can also be simply defined as a strong sense of affection. No matter the definition, love is a powerful emotion that can cause people to change their behaviors and actions.
