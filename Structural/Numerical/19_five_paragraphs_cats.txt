Write a passage with five paragraphs about cats:

There’s something special about cats, the way they move, the way they stare. And when you learn how to love them as they deserve—groom them, give them good food and scratch them, and offer them a litter box—you have created a bond that’s hard to break.

Sure, cats can be fickle—they may ungratefully ignore you when they’re having a bad day—but when they purr or rest their chin on your finger, they let you know that you really matter in their lives.

Cats have been living with humans for at least 9,500 years, and today there are about 500 million domestic cats in the world. But even with all these cats, we still don’t really understand them. Scientists have only recently begun to study cat behavior, and there’s a lot we have yet to learn.

For example, we don’t know why cats purr. It could be a way of self-soothing, or it might be a way of communicating with other cats or with their human companions. We also don’t know why some cats like to be petted while others do not.

But even though we may not always understand them, there’s no denying the special place cats hold in our lives. As the famous author and cat lover Colette once said, “cats are absolute individuals, with their own ideas about everything.” And that’s one of the things we love most about them.
