Write a passage with five paragraphs about cats:

There’s something special about cats, the way they move, the way they stare. And when you learn how to love them as they deserve—groom them, give them good food and scratch them, and offer them a litter box—you have created a bond that’s hard to break.

Sure, cats can be fickle—they may ungratefully ignore you when they’re having a bad day—but when they purr or rest their chin on your finger, they let you know that you really matter in their lives.

Cats have been living with humans for more than 9,000 years, and today there are more than 500 million domestic cats in the world. In the United States alone, there are more than 86 million pet cats.

Most cats are content to live indoors, where they’re protected from the dangers of the outdoors, such as cars, other animals and diseases. But even indoor cats need exercise, and a scratching post or cat tree can give them a place to climb, scratch and stretch.

Cats are relatively low-maintenance pets, but they still need your care and attention. By understanding your cat’s needs and providing them with love and proper care, you can enjoy many years of companionship with your feline friend.
