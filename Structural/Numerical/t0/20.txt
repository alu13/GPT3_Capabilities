Write a passage with five paragraphs about running:

I never used to be a runner. In fact, I used to hate running. It was always something that I had to do, never something that I wanted to do. But then, one day, I decided to give it a try. And you know what? I loved it!

Now, I run every chance I get. I run in the morning, I run in the evening, I even run in the middle of the night if I can’t sleep. Running has become my favorite way to stay fit and healthy.

Not only that, but running has also helped me to clear my mind and to think more clearly. Whenever I have a problem that I need to solve, I go for a run, and by the end of my run, I usually have the solution.

So, if you’ve never been a runner, I encourage you to give it a try. You might just surprise yourself and find that you love it as much as I do.
