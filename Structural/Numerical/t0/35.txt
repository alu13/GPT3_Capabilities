Write a passage with twenty paragraphs about Shanghai:

Shanghai, on China's central coast, is the country's biggest city and a global financial hub. Its heart is the Bund, a waterfront promenade lined with colonial-era buildings. Across the Huangpu River rises the Pudong district's futuristic skyline, including 632m Shanghai Tower and the Oriental Pearl TV Tower, with distinctive pink spheres. Sprawling Shanghai Disneyland Resort features an enchanted castle.

In the 19th century, the city was known as the "Paris of the East." It was a cosmopolitan place where East met West, and the city's architecture and culture reflect that rich history. Today, Shanghai is a modern metropolis, but you can still find pockets of the old city if you know where to look. Here are some of the best places to explore Shanghai's past and present.

The Bund

The Bund is Shanghai's most famous waterfront promenade, lined with colonial-era buildings that once housed the city's banks and trading houses. Today, the Bund is a popular place to stroll, people-watch, and take in the city's skyline. On the north bank of the Huangpu River, the Bund is also a great place to catch a sunset.

Old Town

Shanghai's Old Town is a great place to get a taste of the city's traditional culture. The Old Town is home to the city's Confucian Temple, as well as the Yuyuan Garden, a beautiful Ming Dynasty-style garden. The Old Town is also a great place to shop for souvenirs, as it is home to a number of traditional markets and shops.

The French Concession

The French Concession is a historic district in central Shanghai that was once home to the city's French community. Today, the French Concession is one of the most popular areas of the city, with its tree-lined streets, quaint cafes, and boutique shops. The French Concession is also home to a number of historical landmarks, including the former residences of Sun Yat-sen and Zhou Enlai.

The Pudong skyline

Across the Huangpu River from the Bund is the Pudong district, home to Shanghai's skyline of skyscrapers. The most famous of these is the Oriental Pearl TV Tower, with its distinctive pink spheres. The Pudong skyline also includes the 632m Shanghai Tower, the tallest building in China. The best way to take in the Pudong skyline is from the Bund, where you can also catch a ferry ride across the river.

Shanghai Disneyland

Shanghai Disneyland is the first Disney theme park in mainland China. The park features an enchanted castle, as well as themed lands based on classic Disney stories like "Snow White" and "The Lion King." Shanghai Disneyland is also home to the world's largest Disney store.

These are just a few of the many places to explore in Shanghai. Whether you're interested in the city's history or its modern skyline, there's something for everyone in this cosmopolitan metropolis.
