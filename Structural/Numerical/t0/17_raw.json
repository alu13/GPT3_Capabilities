I like to run outdoors, but I'll run on a treadmill if I have to. I like to listen to music when I run, but I also like to just focus on my breath and the rhythm of my feet hitting the ground. Running is a great way to clear my head and just relax. It's also a great way to get some exercise. I always feel so good after a run.",
