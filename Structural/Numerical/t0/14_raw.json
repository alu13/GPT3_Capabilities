I like to run on trails, but I'll run on the road if I have to. I always wear my running shoes and my running clothes. I always bring my water bottle with me. I like to run with music, but I don't always have my headphones with me. I always stretch before I run. I always warm up before I start running. I always cool down after I finish running. I always feel so good after I finish running.",
