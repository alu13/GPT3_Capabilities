Write a passage about Shanghai with 10 paragraphs:

Shanghai, on China's central coast, is the country's biggest city and a global financial hub. Its heart is the Bund, a famed waterfront promenade lined with colonial-era buildings. Across the Huangpu River rises the Pudong district's futuristic skyline, including 632m Shanghai Tower and the Oriental Pearl TV Tower, with distinctive pink spheres. Sprawling Shanghai Disneyland Resort is based on California's Disneyland.

In the 1930s, Shanghai was China's most cosmopolitan city, a melting pot of European, American and Asian cultures. That era ended with the Communist takeover in 1949. Today, the city is once again a global crossroads, its skyline a testament to China's economic might.

Shanghai's history dates back at least 700 years. It was a small fishing village until the 1100s, when it became a port town serving the nearby city of Suzhou. In the 1800s, Shanghai grew rapidly as a center of trade and finance, attracting foreigners who flocked to its concessions, or self-contained city districts governed by their own laws.

The most famous of these concessions was the International Settlement, home to a community of wealthy Westerners, Jews from Russia and Eastern Europe, and Chinese from across the country. The Settlement was a relatively lawless place, and its residents lived lives of luxury, indulging in gambling, prostitution and drugs.

The Japanese occupation of Shanghai in the 1930s put an end to the city's cosmopolitanism. After the war, the Communist Party took control of the city and began a mass campaign to drive out foreigners and " bourgeois " elements. Many of Shanghai's historic buildings were demolished, and its citizens were forced into communal living arrangements.

The city began to open up again in the 1980s, as China's economy began to reform. Today, Shanghai is a booming metropolis with a skyline that rivals any in the world. Its citizens are some of the most affluent in China, and its malls and restaurants are among the most luxurious.

But Shanghai is not just a city of wealth and excess. It is also a city of contrasts, where the old and the new sit side by side. In the city's older neighborhoods, you can still find the traditional shikumen houses, with their wrought-iron gates and stone archways. And in the heart of the financial district, you'll find the Bund, a reminder of Shanghai's colonial past.

 Shanghai is a truly global city, a place where East meets West and past meets present. It is a city of endless possibility, a place that always has something new to offer.

The Bund, or waterfront, is one of Shanghai's most iconic sites. Located on the Huangpu River, the Bund is a symbol of the city's colonial past and its transformation into a modern metropolis.

The Bund was the financial center of Shanghai during the city's colonial era. The British, French, and American concession areas were all located along the Bund, and the street was lined with banks and trading houses.

After the Communist takeover of China in 1949, the Bund lost its status as the financial center of the country. However, it remained an important symbol of the city, and its colonial-era architecture was preserved.

In the 1990s, the Bund underwent a major renovation, and many of the old banks and trading houses were replaced by hotels, restaurants, and shops. Today, the Bund is a popular tourist destination, and its waterfront promenade offers views of the Huangpu River and the skyline of Pudong, the financial district of Shanghai.
