This led to a period of economic and cultural growth, which can still be seen in the city today.\n\nDuring the 20th century, Shanghai went through a period of decline, first during the Japanese occupation in World War II and then during the Cultural Revolution. However, in the past two decades the city has undergone a renaissance, becoming once again a global center of commerce and culture.\n\nToday, Shanghai is a vibrant, cosmopolitan city, with something to offer everyone.
