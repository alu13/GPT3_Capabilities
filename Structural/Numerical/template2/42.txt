SpaceX and Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, is one of the most innovative and ambitious entrepreneurs of our time.

Musk was born in South Africa in 1971. He showed an early interest in computers and engineering, and at the age of 12, he created a video game called Blastar and sold it for $500. He moved to Canada at the age of 17 to attend Queen's University, and then transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later to study economics and physics.

In 1995, Musk co-founded web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The company was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. Musk co-founded online bank X.com that same year, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form the company we now know as PayPal. eBay acquired PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion.

In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is currently CEO, CTO, and lead designer. The company's first launch took place in March 2006, and they have since completed over 50 launches. In 2012, SpaceX became the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station.

In addition to his work with SpaceX, Musk is also the CEO of Tesla Motors, a company he founded in 2003. Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy through the mass production of electric vehicles. The company's first car, the Tesla Roadster, was released in 2008. Tesla's more affordable Model S sedan followed in 2012, and the Model X SUV was released in 2015.

Musk is also working on a number of other ambitious projects, including The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company, and Neuralink, a company developing brain-computer interfaces.

There is no doubt that Elon Musk is one of the most innovative and ambitious entrepreneurs of our time. His work is changing the world as we know it, and he shows no signs of slowing down.
