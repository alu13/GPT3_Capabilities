It is a global financial center, and a transport hub with the world's busiest container port. Located in the Yangtze River Delta in East China, Shanghai sits on the south edge of the estuary of the Yangtze in the middle portion of the Chinese coast. The municipality borders the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the west, north and northeast, and is bounded to the east by the East China Sea.\n\nThe city was one of five treaty ports forced open to foreign trade following the British victory over China in the First Opium War. The subsequent 1842 Treaty of Nanking and 1844 Treaty of Whampoa allowed the establishment of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. The city then flourished as a center of commerce between China and other parts of the world, and became the primary financial hub of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s. However, with the Communist Party takeover of the mainland in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries, and the city's global influence declined. In the 1990s, the economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping resulted in an intense re-development of the city, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment to the city.\n\nThe two Chinese characters in the city's name (\u4e0a and \u6d77) are pronounced Sh\u00e0ng and H\u01cei respectively, giving rise to the city's alternative name, the Mouth of the Sea. A prominent city feature, the Bund refers to the area along the Huangpu River that forms the western section of the city's waterfront.\n\nThe city has many nicknames in English, including \"Pearl of the Orient\" and \"Paris of the East\". Its French Concession was once the largest concession in the world.\n\nShanghai has several thousand years of history dating back to at least the Spring and Autumn period. The city's earliest recorded name was Shen (\u6c88), after its state of Wu, which was itself founded by the Han dynasty in 473 BC. During the Tang dynasty, the area was renamed the County of Shanghai (\u4e0a\u6d77\u90e1), and became a county of the first-tier prefecture Suzhou. The name later appeared in Marco Polo's Travels, as he noted that Shanghai was the port for the Chinese products he had seen in India.\n\nThe Song dynasty made Shanghai a county seat, and the Yangshao and Longshan cultures flourished in the area. The area was part of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, and then the later Liang Dynasty. In AD 907, the newly established Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (\u592a\u5e73\u5929\u56ef) made Shanghai its capital, and in AD 1276 it became a commandery seat. The Mongol Yuan dynasty (\u5143\u671d) took control of China in AD 1279, and Shanghai became its capital in AD 1354. From the Yuan to the Qing, Shanghai was a center of maritime trade and enjoyed immense prosperity. The city was renowned for its rich local culture and cuisine, as well as its status as a major East-Asian economic and commercial hub.\n\nThe Republic of China (ROC) overthrew the Qing in 1911 and established its capital in Nanjing. However, the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 caused the central government to relocate to Chongqing. Shanghai then became a focal point of the war, with heavy fighting taking place in and around the city. The city was occupied by the Japanese in 1937 and remained under Japanese control until the end of the war in 1945.\n\nAfter the war, Shanghai reverted to Chinese control, and experienced a rapid economic and population recovery. The Communist Party of China took control of the city in 1949, and proclaimed it the People's Republic of China's (PRC) de facto capital. In the following years, the city was the site of large-scale redevelopment projects, including the construction of the Shanghai Pudong New Area and the transformation of the former French Concession into a financial district.\n\nIn the early 21st century, Shanghai emerged as a global city, exerting a strong influence over commerce, finance, culture, technology and transport in East Asia. It is a hub for air and rail transport, and has the world's busiest container port. The city is also a major center for higher education, with over 100 universities and colleges.\n\nShanghai has a humid subtropical climate and experiences four distinct seasons. Spring is generally pleasant, with cool to warm weather and occasional showers. Summer is hot and humid, with occasional thunderstorms. Autumn is cool and dry, with clear skies. Winter is chilly and dry, with occasional snowfall.\n\nThe city is home to a number of world-renowned museums, including the Shanghai Museum, the China Art",
