It is a major center for outstanding universities, such as Fudan University and Tongji University. Shanghai has been described as the \"showpiece\" of the booming economy of mainland China.\n\nThe two Chinese characters in the city's name are \u4e0a (sh\u00e0ng, \"on\" or \"above\") and \u6d77 (h\u01cei, \"sea\"), together meaning \"Upon-the-Sea\". The earliest occurrence of this name dates from the 11th-century Song dynasty, at which time there was already a river confluence and a town with this name in the area. There are disputes as to exactly how the name should be interpreted, but Chinese historians have generally agreed that during the Tang dynasty Shanghai was literally on the sea. Shanghai is commonly abbreviated \u6caa (H\u00f9) in Chinese, a contraction of \u6caa\u6e0e (H\u00f9 D\u00fa, lit. \"Horton Bay\"), a 4th- or 5th-century Jin name for the mouth of Suzhou Creek when it was the main conduit into the ocean. This character appears on all motor vehicle license plates issued in the municipality today.\n\nAnother alternative name for Shanghai is Sh\u0113n (\u7533), after its abbreviation (\u7533\u6caa), a name often used for the city in the past. During the mid-19th century, Westerners referred to the city as Siganapur or Singanapur, a corruption of the name that is still used in some non-Mandarin-speaking areas of the city today.\n\nThe city also has various nicknames in English, including \"Pearl of the Orient\" and \"Paris of the East\".",
