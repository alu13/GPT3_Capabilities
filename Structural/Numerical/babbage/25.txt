Write a passage with twenty paragraphs about cats:

I've always loved cats. I always thought they were so cute and cuddly. I never really knew what to make of them though. They are so different from dogs, but I never really knew how to explain it to people. I always thought they were strange. But I started to really get to know them when I moved to a house with a cat. The cat was so friendly and she would lay in the middle of the room with her date. I never thought of her as strange anymore. I started to see her as one of my friends. I love cats and I think they love me back.
