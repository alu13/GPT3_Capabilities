This will help you build up your endurance and stamina. If you need to, you can break up your run into smaller segments throughout the day.\n\nAs you keep running, you\u2019ll start to notice yourself getting stronger and faster. This is normal! Just keep pushing yourself and challenge yourself to run a little bit further or a little bit faster each time you go out.\n\nEventually, you\u2019ll find that running is something you enjoy and look forward to. It\u2019s a great way to clear your head, get some exercise, and just feel good. Keep at it, and you\u2019ll be a runner in no time!",
