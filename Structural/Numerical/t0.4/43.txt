He is the founder, CEO, CTO, and chief designer of SpaceX; early investor, CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink; and co-founder and initial co-chairman of OpenAI. A centibillionaire, Musk is one of the richest people in the world.

Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada aged 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received dual bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The start-up was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. Musk co-founded online bank X.com that same year, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form the company PayPal and was subsequently bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.

In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO, CTO, and lead designer. In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect, becoming its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services company and current Tesla subsidiary. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that promotes friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has also proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system.

Musk was an early investor and executive in Tesla, Inc., providing the company with initial funding and serving as its chairman from 2004 to 2006, CEO from 2008 to 2013, and product architect from 2004 to 2019. He has also proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system.

Musk has received several honors and recognition for his work. In 2015, he was ranked 21st on Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People and was ranked co-equal with Bill Gates. In 2016, he was ranked 35th on Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People and was ranked co-equal with Mark Zuckerberg. In 2017, he was ranked 31st on the Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People and was ranked co-equal with Jeff Bezos. In March 2018, Musk was granted permission to build a Hyperloop in the United Kingdom.

In December 2016, Musk was ranked 8th on Fortune's World's Greatest Leaders list. In October 2016, Musk was ranked 25th on Vanity Fair's New Establishment list.

Musk has also received criticism for his business practices and statements. In May 2018, he was sued for defamation by British cave explorer Vernon Unsworth, who was involved in the rescue of a Thai soccer team from a flooded cave, after Musk called him a "pedo guy" on Twitter. The trial began in December 2019.

In August 2018, Musk was accused of fraud by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for making false and misleading statements about taking Tesla private. Musk agreed to pay a $20 million fine and step down as Tesla's chairman, but remained CEO.

In September 2019, The Washington Post published an investigation into working conditions at Tesla factories, which concluded that Tesla had failed to address "serious workplace safety issues." In November 2019, a jury found Tesla guilty of failing to provide a safe workplace at its Fremont, California factory, and ordered the company to pay $240,000 in damages.

In December 2019, it was revealed that Musk had been in talks with the U.S. Air Force to build a new version of the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor fighter jet. The project was cancelled after the Air Force decided not to proceed with it.

In May 2020, Musk was sued by the SEC for tweeting "false and misleading" statements about Tesla's production numbers. The SEC sought to have Musk banned from serving as an officer or director of a public company, but the judge ruled that Musk could remain CEO of Tesla.

In July 2020, Musk was sued by British cave explorer Vernon

Musk has also proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system.

Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa,[27] the son of Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, and Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, and sailor. He has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[28][29] His paternal grandmother was British, and he also has Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry,[30][31] and his maternal grandfather was American, from Minnesota.[32] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria.[32]

During his childhood he had an interest in reading and often did so for hours at a time.[33] At age 10, he developed an interest in computing with the Commodore VIC-20.[34] He taught himself computer programming at the age of 12, sold the code for a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar for $500, and bought a used computer with his earnings. A web version of the game is available online.[35][36]

Musk was severely bullied throughout his childhood, and was once hospitalized when a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs and then beat him until he was unconscious.[37][38]

Musk was initially educated at private schools, attending the English-speaking Waterkloof House Preparatory School. Musk later switched to Pretoria Boys High School, a renowned local Afrikaans-language school.[32]

As a teenager, Musk was an avid reader of science fiction and fantasy novels, and was deeply influenced by the works of Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein.[39][40] When he was 17, he visited Canada for the first time to attend Queen's University, and he decided to stay and transfer to the University of Pennsylvania two years later.[41][42] In 1995, while attending Penn, Musk and fellow Penn student Adeo Ressi rented a 10-bedroom fraternity house, using it as an unofficial nightclub.[43] During their time at the house, they had a variety of housemates, including future actor Todd Barry and comedian Joe Rogan.[44]

Musk and Ressi co-founded the web software company Zip2 in 1995, with money raised from a small group of angel investors. The start-up was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999.[45][46] Musk co-founded online bank X.com that same year, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form the company PayPal and was subsequently bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.[47]
