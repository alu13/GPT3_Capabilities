It is a global financial center, and a transport hub with the world's busiest container port. Located in the Yangtze River Delta in East China, Shanghai sits on the south edge of the mouth of the Yangtze in the middle portion of the Chinese coast. The municipality borders the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the north, south and west, and is bounded to the east by the East China Sea.\n\nThe name Shanghai literally means \"On the Sea\". A prominent city during the 19th- and early 20th-centuries, Shanghai grew in importance as a result of trade and recognition of its favorable port location and economic potential. The city was one of five treaty ports forced open to foreign trade following the British victory over China in the First Opium War. The subsequent 1842 Treaty of Nanking and 1844 Treaty of Whampoa allowed the establishment of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. The city then flourished as a center of commerce between China and other parts of the world, and became the primary financial hub of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s.\n\nHowever, with the Communist Party takeover of the mainland in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries, and the city's global influence declined. In the 1990s, the economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping resulted in an intense re-development of the city, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment to the city. The two Chinese characters in the city's name are \u4e0a (sh\u00e0ng, \"on\" or \"above\") and \u6d77 (h\u01cei, \"sea\"), together meaning \"Upon-the-Sea\". The earliest occurrence of this name dates from the 11th-century Song Dynasty, when there was already a river confluence and a town with this name in the area. There are disputes as to exactly how the name should be understood, but Chinese historians have concluded that during the Tang Dynasty Shanghai was literally on the sea.\n\nShanghai is the largest city in China in terms of population and one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world, with over 24 million people. The city is located on the Yangtze River Delta on the east coast of China, and is the country's largest economic center. Shanghai is a global city, and is one of the world's busiest container ports.

The city has been a major center of trade and commerce for centuries, and was one of the five treaty ports opened to foreign trade in the 19th century. The city was also the site of major anti-foreigner riots in the early 20th century.\n\nSince the economic reforms of the 1990s, Shanghai has once again become a major center of commerce and finance, and is now one of the most important cities in the world.",
