It is a global financial center, and a transport hub with the world's busiest container port. Located in the Yangtze River Delta in East China, Shanghai sits on the south edge of the mouth of the Yangtze in the middle portion of the Chinese coast. The municipality borders the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the north, south, and west, and is bounded to the east by the East China Sea.\n\nThe city was one of five treaty ports forced open to foreign trade following the British victory over China in the First Opium War. The subsequent 1842 Treaty of Nanking and 1844 Treaty of Whampoa allowed the establishment of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. The city then flourished as a center of commerce between China and other parts of the world, and became the primary financial hub of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s. However, with the Communist Party takeover of the mainland in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries, and the city's global influence declined. In the 1990s, the economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping resulted in an intense re-development of the city, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment to the city.\n\nThe two Chinese characters in the city's name (\u4e0a and \u6d77) together mean \"Upon-the-Sea\". The earliest occurrence of this name dates from the 11th-century Song Dynasty, when there was already a river confluence and a town with this name in the area. There are disputes as to exactly how the name should be understood, but Chinese historians have concluded that during the Tang Dynasty Shanghai was literally on the sea.\n\nShanghai is the largest city by population in China and the largest city proper in the world. It is the country's most populous city proper and the largest metropolis by population in the world. According to the 2010 census, the city has 24,153,000 inhabitants, while the Shanghai metropolitan area has 23,836,000 inhabitants. Shanghai is a global city, with influence in commerce, culture, finance, media, fashion, technology, and transport. It is a major financial center and the busiest container port in the world.",
