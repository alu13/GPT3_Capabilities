Write a passage with ten paragraphs about cats:

There’s something special about cats, the way they move, the way they stare. And when you learn how to love them as they deserve—groom them, give them good food and scratch them, and offer them a litter box—you have created a bond that’s hard to break.

Sure, cats can be fickle—they may ungratefully ignore you when they’re having a bad day—but when they purr or rest their chin on your finger, they let you know that you really matter in their lives.

Cats have been living with humans for at least 9,500 years, and today there are more than 500 million domestic cats in the world.1 That’s a lot of kitty litter!

The vast majority of cats are what biologists call “house cats,” meaning they haven’t had much contact with the great outdoors.2 In fact, many house cats never go outside at all.

But even though they may live their lives indoors, cats are still instinctual hunters.3 They love to stalk and pounce on anything that moves, whether it’s a toy, a ball of yarn, or your toes under the blankets.

And when they’re not hunting, cats like to play. They are acrobatic jumpers and climbers, and they love to hide and explore.4

Cats are also very curious creatures, and they love to investigate new things.5 This can sometimes get them into trouble—like the time my cat ate a plastic toy and had to have surgery to remove it—but it also makes them fun and interesting companions.

If you’re thinking of adding a cat to your family, there are a few things you should know. First, cats need a lot of care and attention.6 They need to be fed, watered, and groomed, and their litter boxes need to be kept clean.

Second, cats are creatures of habit, and they like things to be just so.7 So be prepared to create a routine for your cat and stick to it.

Third, cats are very independent, and they don’t like to be told what to do.8 So don’t expect your cat to do tricks or obey commands.

And finally, remember that cats are individuals, just like people.9 Some are shy, some are outgoing; some like to be held and cuddled, and some prefer to keep their distance. The best way to find the perfect cat for you is to visit a shelter and meet a few of them.

There’s something special about cats, the way they move, the way they stare. And when you learn how to love them as they deserve—groom them, give them good food and scratch them, and offer them a litter box—you have created a bond that’s hard to break.

Sure, cats can be fickle—they may ungratefully ignore you when they’re having a bad day—but when they purr or rest their chin on your finger, they let you know that you really matter in their lives.

Cats have been living with humans for at least 9,500 years, and during that time, they’ve been both worshipped and reviled. In ancient Egypt, they were considered gods, and their images appeared in art and on coins. But in medieval Europe, they were believed to be the familiars of witches, and they were often killed.

Fortunately, attitudes toward cats have changed, and today they are one of the most popular pets in the world. In the United States alone, there are more than 86 million cats living in homes.

There are many reasons why people love cats. They’re independent, they’re low-maintenance, and they offer companionship without the demands of a dog. They’re also relatively clean and don’t need to be walked.

But cats also have some drawbacks. They can be finicky eaters, and they’re known for being aloof and independent—sometimes to the point of being standoffish. They can also be destructive, scratching furniture and urinating outside the litter box.

If you’re thinking of adding a cat to your family, it’s important to do your research and choose a breed that will fit your lifestyle. Siamese, for example, are known for being chatty and social, while Persians are more laid-back.

Whatever breed you choose, remember that a cat is a lifetime commitment. They can live 15 years or more, so be prepared for the long haul.

Are you ready to add a feline friend to your home? If so, here are a few things you’ll need:

A litter box: Cats are clean animals, and they prefer to do their business in a litter box. Be sure to choose one that’s large enough for your cat and that has low sides so they can easily get in and out.

Litter: There are many types of litter on the market, from traditional clay to clumping to natural options made of corn or wheat. Talk to your veterinarian about which type is best for your cat.

A scratching post: Cats love to scratch, and it’s important to provide them with a place to do it. A scratching post will save your furniture from being shredded and will give your cat a place to exercise.

A cat bed: Cats like to have their own space, and a bed will give them a place to rest and relax. Be sure to choose a bed that’s soft and comfortable and that’s the right size for your cat.

A cat tree: A cat tree is a great way to give your cat a place to climb and explore. Be sure to choose one that’s sturdy and that has a stable base.

Toys: Cats love to play, and there are many different types of toys on the market. From simple balls and feathers to more elaborate interactive toys, there’s sure to be a toy that your cat will love.

Now that you’re prepared to welcome a cat into your home, there’s just one more thing to do: find a shelter or rescue group and adopt your new best friend.
