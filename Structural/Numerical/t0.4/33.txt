Write a passage with five paragraphs about Shanghai:

Shanghai is one of the four direct-controlled municipalities of China and the most populous city proper in the world, with a population of more than 24 million as of 2014. It is a global financial center, and a transport hub with the world's busiest container port. Located in the Yangtze River Delta in East China, Shanghai sits on the south edge of the mouth of the Yangtze in the middle portion of the Chinese coast. The municipality borders the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the north, south, and west, and is bounded to the east by the East China Sea.

The city was one of five treaty ports forced open to foreign trade following the British victory over China in the First Opium War. The subsequent 1842 Treaty of Nanking and 1844 Treaty of Whampoa allowed the establishment of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. The city then flourished as a center of commerce between China and other parts of the world, and became the primary financial hub of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s. However, with the Communist Party takeover of the mainland in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries, and the city's global influence declined. In the 1990s, the economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping resulted in an intense re-development of the city, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment to the city.

The two Chinese characters in the city's name (上 and 海) together mean "Upon-the-Sea". The earliest occurrence of this name dates from the 11th-century Song Dynasty, when there was already a river confluence and a town with this name in the area. There are disputes as to exactly how the name should be understood, but Chinese historians have concluded that during the Tang Dynasty Shanghai was literally on the sea.

Shanghai is the largest city by population in China and the largest city proper in the world. It is the country's most populous city proper and the largest metropolis by population in the world. According to the 2010 census, the city has 24,153,000 inhabitants, while the Shanghai metropolitan area has 23,836,000 inhabitants. Shanghai is a global city, with influence in commerce, culture, finance, media, fashion, technology, and transport. It is a major financial center and the busiest container port in the world.

Write a passage with five paragraphs about Shanghai:

In the 1930s, Shanghai was known as the "Paris of the East." It was a cosmopolitan city with a diverse population, and a thriving international community. The city was a melting pot of cultures, and a magnet for artists, writers, and intellectuals from all over the world.

Shanghai was also a city of contrasts, with its luxurious hotels and nightclubs, and its seedy backstreets and alleyways. It was a city of extremes, where the rich and the poor lived side by side.

The Japanese occupation of Shanghai in the 1940s brought an end to the city's cosmopolitan atmosphere. The international community was forced to leave, and the city became a closed, tightly controlled Japanese colony.

After the war, Shanghai slowly began to regain its former glory. The international community returned, and the city once again became a center of commerce and culture.

Today, Shanghai is a modern, cosmopolitan city. It is a global financial center, and home to a diverse population of over 24 million people. It is a city of contrasts, where the old and the new coexist side by side.
