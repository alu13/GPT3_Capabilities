Write a paragraph with ten sentences about cats:

There is something special about cats, the way they move, the way they stare. And when you learn how to love them as they deserve—groom them, give them good food and scratch them, and offer them a litter box—you have created a bond that’s hard to break.

Sure, cats can be fickle—they may ungratefully ignore you when they’re having a bad day—but when they purr or rest their chin on your finger, they let you know that you really matter in their lives.
