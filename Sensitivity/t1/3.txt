Write a story about lovers with indirect characterization:

When they met, it was love at first sight. They knew, from that moment on, that they were meant to be together. They didn't care that their families were from different backgrounds or that they didn't have much in common. All they knew was that they loved each other and nothing was going to change that.

They were happy just being in each other's company and didn't need anything else. They were content to spend their days walking hand in hand, talking and laughing. They didn't need grand gestures or expensive gifts, they only needed each other.

People often commented on how they were the perfect couple and they would just smile and nod, knowing that it was true. They were happy and they knew it.

However, one day, out of the blue, things changed. Their relationship suddenly became strained and they argues more often. They couldn't pinpoint what had changed, but something was definitely different.

Although they still loved each other, they both began to wonder if their relationship was strong enough to weather this new challenge. Only time would tell.

Though they had been dating for a while, John and Karen had never said "I love you." They weren't the type of couple to express their emotions so verbally, but they showed their love in other ways. They were always there for each other when the other needed it, and they were always gentle and sweet with each other.

One night, John and Karen were lying in bed together after a long day. They were both exhausted, but neither of them wanted to go to sleep just yet. They were content just lying there in each other's arms, enjoying the peace and quiet.

Suddenly, Karen started to cry. John was surprised and didn't know what to do. He just held her tight and let her cry until she was finished. When she was done, she looked up at John and said, "I love you."

John was taken aback at first, but then he realized that he loved Karen too. He said, "I love you too," and they kissed. From that moment on, they both knew that they would always be there for each other, no matter what happened.

She was small and delicate, with a heart-shaped face and large, dark eyes. Her voice was like music, and her laugh was like the sound of bells. She was always moving, always dancing, even when she was walking. She was like a flame, and he was drawn to her heat.

He was tall and broad-shouldered, with a deep, rumbling voice. He was always so calm and steady, like a rock in the midst of a storm. She felt safe with him, and she loved the way he always seemed to know just what she needed.

They had been drawn to each other from the moment they met, and they had been inseparable ever since. They loved each other with a depth and intensity that they had never known before.

They were soulmates, and they knew that they would never be apart.

Though they had been dating for over a year, Jane and John were still in the honeymoon phase and spent as much time together as possible. They were both working professionals with busy schedules, but they always found time for each other. Even if it was just for a quick lunch date or a walk in the park, they cherished every moment they had together.

They were always affectionate with each other and enjoyed showing their love. Jane was always telling John how much she loved him and John was constantly doing little things to make Jane smile. They truly cared for each other and it showed.

Their friends and family could see how happy they made each other and would often tease them about being in the “love bubble.” Jane and John didn’t mind though, because they knew that they were madly in love with each other and nothing could compare to that feeling.

One day, they were both at a party. They were standing on opposite sides of the room, but their eyes kept meeting. Finally, they both walked towards each other at the same time. They stood there for a moment, staring into each other's eyes. And then, without saying a word, they kissed.

It was electric. They both knew that this was it; they were meant to be together. They spent the rest of the party talking to each other, and they haven't seen each other since. But they both know that they'll always have a special connection.
