(3) In high school and college, I ran track and cross country because I wanted to get in good shape and because I thought it would be fun. I ran because I needed the extra exercise.

The plane is not painted with the paint that covers the wings of most airplanes. The paint is a bright green that is faded and almost worn away.

"I am a runner. I started running in my early twenties, and I am now a competitive runner. There are many reasons I love running. I love how my body feels when I am running, how the air feels on my face, how I feel my muscles working. I love that as I run I don’t think about anything but how much longer I have to go. I love it when I hear my name and see my friends cheering me on. Running has taught me to be patient, to take my time, to pace myself. I had to learn how to push myself, to be strong, to hold on. During the 2004 Olympics, I watched the men’s marathon in Athens. I was so inspired by their determination and endurance. I wanted to be a part of the marathon. That year I competed in my first half marathon. I ran it with my friend and mentor, Dick Shuman. I ran it with my friends, my family, and my coach. I finished 12th in my age bracket, and I was so happy. I found my passion. I started training and training and training. I ran my first marathon in 2008. I finished 16th overall in my age"

"The most important thing is to get started. You can't run if you don't get started. The second thing is to keep at it. You'll lose your running shoes, you'll fall, maybe you'll get hurt, but you have to keep at it. The third thing is to find a good coach. If you don't have a good coach, you'll never learn to run. The fourth thing is to find a good training group. Get out there, get in shape, and run with others on a regular basis. The fifth thing is to keep after it. Don't quit because somebody else got a new car or you're tired. The sixth thing is to get your feet wet. Start with walking, walking intervals, or even jogging. Do it for a week and see how far you can go. The seventh thing is to run to the finish. Don't run to finish the race, run to finish the course! There are many other things to think about, but those are the most important. You have to get started, and you have to keep at it to get somewhere. ### **_""I need to run more.""_** _""I need to run more"
