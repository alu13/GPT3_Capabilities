"“Now the sun was setting. In the sky between the suburb and the sea there was a livid, opalescent haze, and in the sky above the sea-gulls, like a crown of flame, the sun had just set.” That’s not writing, that’s prose. What the author has to do now is figure out what the object and the subject are. In the case of the seagull, it’s the object. The sun is the subject—the writer has to get the sun down on paper first. First he writes “Sunset and seagulls.” That’s the object. Now he writes “The sun is setting.” That’s the subject. Write the sentence again, but this time, put the object first: “A livid, opalescent haze was in the sky between the suburb and the sea. The sun was setting in the sky above the sea-gulls, like a crown of flame.” That’s the new version. It’s got the sun first, and the seagull second. That tells me, the reader, that the sun is the subject and that the seagull is the object. The sun is setting. It’s the main"

"""The sunset was a flower of flame. A great red flower, the flower of the multitudes"" ( _Sophocles_ , 936). 1. _Ambition_ : The ambition of the poet to compete with Homer, to surpass him, to surpass his own works, to equal the _Iliad_ in power, in glory, and in drama, to surpass it in eloquence, in sublimity, in genius, and to surpass it in beauty. 2. _Livy_ : (1) One of the great historians of antiquity, the principal source of the _Iliad_. He is the author of the _Histories_ , which are a chronicle of Roman history from the fall of Troy to the death of Augustus (2) The _Historia Augusta_ , which gives a report of ancient Roman history from Augustus to the death of Marcus Aurelius. 3. _Book_ : The opening book of the _Iliad_. 4. _Romanticism_ : The triumph of the romantic school of poetry and painting in Europe in the nineteenth century.

"“I look out the window and there it is! It is not what it once was, and I know that I cannot go back to the way it was, but it is still a wonder and a treasure. It is still the world.” When you are finished, read it aloud. Listening to you read your poem aloud is one of the great joys of writing poetry. 3. Ask yourself, “Does this poem have heart?” Heart is a quality that appears in poems that speak from the feelings and mind of the writer. Heart is the place where everything you’ve learned and everything you’ve felt about the world and your life comes together to create a unique vision that makes your poem your own. Do you feel the connection between your heart and your words? Do you feel the passion in your words? 4. Play, play, play. Poetry is play. It is exuberance, excitement, and joy. Play is the place where the real world of your life meets the imaginary world of poetry. It is the place where the words fly out of your mouth without you trying. It is the place where you are free to create anything you want. Play is where you go to escape the world. But more than that, it is"
"""A gold-green color is seen in the west, which gradually changes into a purple tint."" If that doesn't make you pause and consider what the author means, you're not a serious reader. You're a sucker. ### **_The Author's Slant_** Every book has an author's slant, a point of view. If you want to understand what the author means, take a step back and examine the slant. If you don't understand what the author is saying, try asking yourself, ""From where did he get the idea that this is true?"" The author's slant becomes clearer if you read in the order in which he or she wrote. If you start with the beginning and work your way backward, you'll see the author's point of view unfold. If you start in the middle, you'll see it emerge from the other side. ### **_The Author's Audience_** The author's audience is nearly always obvious. But there are a few unusual cases in which the author's audience is not. If the author's audience is not obvious, ask yourself, ""Who is the author trying to reach?"" You might read,"
"""The sun was going down on the western horizon"". This is bad. You might as well write ""The sun was going down"". Write a flowery passage about the sun going down: ""The sun was setting on the western horizon"". This is better, because the sun is the subject of the sentence. Write a flowery passage about the sunset: ""The sun was setting behind the western horizon"". Now you have a subject and a verb. Write a flowery passage about sunsets: ""The sun was setting behind the western horizon"", as you have a subject, a verb, and a preposition. But the preposition is ""behind"" (it is the subject of the sentence, because it is the object of ""setting""). There is no place for a comma here. Write a flowery passage about sunsets: ""The sun was setting behind the western horizon."" This is still all right. Write a flowery passage about sunsets, and the sun setting behind the western horizon: ""The sun was setting behind the western horizon"". Now you have a subject, a verb, a preposition, and a noun. But you still have no place for a comma. Write a flowery passage about sunsets and the sun setting behind the western"
"Write a hill-tribe elder telling a story. A line from a poem. Encourage your students to write in a variety of styles. It's good practice for their future writing. 2. Develop a writing unit that will introduce your students to different types of writing. Be sure to include a variety of genres as well as a variety of methods of writing. Students will be more likely to want to read and write if they know what to expect. For example, we had a writing unit where we read the same book, The Three Little Pigs, and then wrote the story as different genres: a story-poem, a story-prose, a story-story, and a story-poem-story. We also did a lesson on essays, and we wrote essays. We also did a unit on research papers and boy, did we have some problems then! It was wonderful to see students who struggled to write research papers in English become proficient writers in the science program. We also did a unit on how to write for the media and included some writing for the web. Another unit we did was a unit on writing for children's magazines. We had several teachers who published their own children's magazines. We learned all about"
"""The sky was a brilliant blue, and all the golden glory was in the sky, and the gold was as golden as any gold that ever was."" That's how I would write it. The other day I was reading the New York Times Book Review, and I came across the following review: ""The book is about a man who has a nervous breakdown, and the book is very funny, very sad and, in its way, a wonderful portrait of the world."" If you read that, you would think that the book is about a man who has a nervous breakdown and that the book is very funny, very sad and, in its way, a wonderful portrait of the world. But that's not the book. That's how it would be described. But that's not what the book is about. A book should be about something. It should be about something . . . it should be about something that has a little corn on it, a little smidgen of corn. The book should be about something that is a little nutty, that's a little off. That's what a book is about. It's about something that is a little nutty. I think it's about something"
"have the reader's eyes fill with tears. Why: A good book should be a document, not a fairy tale; the author's job is to record the truth. But a writer should always include something that's true and beautiful—a graceful phrase, a vivid image, a tender passage. And that's why the best writers are _honest_ —they allow the reader to see and touch the truth, no matter how delicate or painful it may be. _Write in a way that lets the person who reads you know his own thoughts and feelings better than he knows them himself._ —JAMES DEAN **HOW TO** write a _good_ story: **1.** **Distill your life into a single story that has one central idea.** The best stories are the ones that have a single idea, and that idea is always the same. And the more of your life you can distill into one story, the better. Consider the following: • _The one thing that makes all your life worthwhile is your family._ • _The one thing that makes all your life worthwhile is your work._ • _The one thing that makes all your life worthwhile is your friendships._"
"""A bluish-red nimbus seems to rise from the horizon, and as it sinks beneath the Marble Cliffs, it spreads itself upon the sea, and tinges the river with a roseate hue."" How do you write a line like that, through which the reader might wander? Write a line like that and you'll have a book of poems. ### _The Heroic Imperative_ I know of no single literary lesson more important than this: the lesson that it is the writer's job to be a hero. To be a hero is to be right, and to be right is to be righteous. To be righteous is to be generous, for the generous man must be generous even to those who have wronged him, for he is certain of his own rectitude. To be generous is to be generous even to those who have wronged you, for you are certain of your own rectitude. To be righteous is to be generous, and to be generous is to be righteous. To be generous is to be generous even to those who are wronged by you, for you are certain of your own rectitude, which is the only rectitude, because only a certain rectitude"
