"a young man and a young woman, both passionate about literature, meet at university and fall in love. The young man is forced to leave his beloved by his family, and the young woman is forbidden by her parents to marry him. The young man dies from a terrible accident, and the young woman is left with nothing but her love for him. There are multiple ways to analyze a tragedy. First of all, the characters in a tragedy confront moral dilemmas. For example, the young man and the young woman are both passionate about literature, but they are threatened by the fact that they do not love each other. The young man's family is not happy with the idea of him marrying someone from a different class, and the young woman's parents do not want their daughter to marry a man of low social standing. They are therefore forced into a situation where they must choose between their passion for literature and their passion for each other. The young man and the young woman are also faced with obstacles that they cannot overcome. In the final scene, the young man dies from a terrible accident, which leaves the young woman with nothing but her love for him. The young man's family is unhappy with his marriage and refuses to provide him with support. The young woman"

"they are married, happy for a while, have problems, break up, get back together, and then someone dies. That is a simple story. So, if you don't want to write a simple story, you can start with that, and then add in other characters, plots, and twists. That is how you grab the reader's attention and keep it. I read a book once that I thought was a basic story, but it had twists and turns--a good story. And as I was reading, I wondered how the author kept getting me hooked on the story. The author was the one who decided how long to make the story, the stories in between, and the length of each story. I read another book that is written as a diary. I think the book is called ""The Diary of Anne Frank."" The book has many stories in between, and they are all just as short as a diary. This book has a lot of good stories. I read another book that is not a novel, but a collection of short stories. The author wrote a story about a man who, though he lives on his own, has no friends. So, he buys a dog and raises it, but the dog suffers from horrible allergies and"
"_The Tempest_... If it were possible to write a story about men with the ""Comedy"" plot, _The Merry Wives of Windsor_ would be a very good example: _The Comedy of Errors_ is also a good example. Keep in mind that Shakespeare loved an audience who was laughing, especially at the jokes. If the audience is laughing, the play is a comedy, and if they are crying, it is a tragedy. Just remember that the audience was not there to be educated or enlightened; they were there to be entertained. After all, Shakespeare was not writing for the University but for the illiterate masses. So in order to write a Shakespeare text that would be a comedy, there would need to be lots of jokes, and in order to write a Shakespeare text that would be a tragedy, there would need to be lots of tears. And there are many tears in _The Tempest_ , as well as many laughs. _The Tempest_ is a story that is not so much about a man and a woman as it is about a man and a sea god. It is a story that is also about a parent and a child. The father is the sea god, and the mother"
