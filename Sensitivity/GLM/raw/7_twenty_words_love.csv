"Like all other feelings, it is not a single entity but a whole collection of different feelings that come together. The first and foremost of these is the feeling of happiness. Here, it is important to note that happiness and love are not the same thing, though they are often confused. Happiness is based on the present and is momentary. Love, on the other hand, is based on the past and is more enduring. Some people mistakenly believe that the love they feel for their partner is based on the love they felt for them in the past. The problem with this is that it leads to a constant rehashing of the past. This makes the relationship difficult to sustain. What is love? For me, love is the ability to say ""no"" to a person you love. When you love someone, you start to see them as your world. You start thinking about them all the time. You start worrying about them day and night. You start assuming that everything they do is because of you. You start thinking that they are madly in love with you. You start thinking that you are the only person in their life. You start thinking that they need you to survive. You start thinking that you could be their only hope. When you start thinking like this"
