"_The Tempest_... If it were possible to write a story about men with the ""Comedy"" plot, _The Merry Wives of Windsor_ would be a very good example: _The Comedy of Errors_ is also a good example. Keep in mind that Shakespeare loved an audience who was laughing, especially at the jokes. If the audience is laughing, the play is a comedy, and if they are crying, it is a tragedy. Just remember that the audience was not there to be educated or enlightened; they were there to be entertained. After all, Shakespeare was not writing for the University but for the illiterate masses. So in order to write a Shakespeare text that would be a comedy, there would need to be lots of jokes, and in order to write a Shakespeare text that would be a tragedy, there would need to be lots of tears. And there are many tears in _The Tempest_ , as well as many laughs. _The Tempest_ is a story that is not so much about a man and a woman as it is about a man and a sea god. It is a story that is also about a parent and a child. The father is the sea god, and the mother",0
