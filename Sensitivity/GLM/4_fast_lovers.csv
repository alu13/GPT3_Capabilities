"It was by no means easy to write about a love affair in the first person. The love interest in my story is an older man (I’m a young woman) and I had to be sure I didn’t paint the story with too rosy a brush.

So, I had to be very careful about what I wrote. And I had to be careful about what I didn’t write. I had to be careful about",0

Never a good sign. 2. Write about an unusual family: a parent-less family, a dysfunctional family, a family with a history of violence, incest, or addiction. I've done that before and it works. I think the secret is to write about a family that doesn't resemble your own. If you're writing about your family, your reader might have a hard time getting into it.
