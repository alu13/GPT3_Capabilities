"Choose a character from one of the stories you read and write a short story about this character. You can choose who you are writing about, how you are writing about them, and what you are writing about them. The only rule is that you must use indirect characterization.

We have to imagine the person we are talking about and then write down how we feel about that person. We have to use what we know about the person we are talking about, but we have to tell a story about that person.
