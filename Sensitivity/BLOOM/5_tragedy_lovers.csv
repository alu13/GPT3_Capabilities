"... but I don't know how to write the plot

I need some help with my story. I have to create a story of lovers but I don't know how to write it because I don't know what to write in the plot.
This is the plot:

Tragedy: It is the plot of a story in which a couple of lovers are separated by an external force. This is the most common plot in Greek tragedy, especially in ancient times, when the gods were the ones that used to separate the lovers. But it can also be a story of lovers in which they are separated by social differences, by death, by differences of opinion...

What do I do now? I don't know what to write. I have to write this about a couple of lovers. Help, please.

A:

The plot you describe is the foundation of the vast majority of romance stories. There are two kinds of possible endings for a romance novel. Either the couple is reunited or they are not. If they are not, the couple has been separated by forces outside of their control and the story ends with the characters either dead or broken. Either way, the couple has been separated by something that exists outside of their control. I don't count stories where there is",0
"I wrote a story about a woman who had a stroke, was in a coma, and even if she survived, she would be mentally impaired. She has a boyfriend, but he is in love with another woman. The other woman has a boyfriend too. The boyfriend of the woman who has a stroke has to choose between his girlfriend in a coma, and his girlfriend who is alive. He has to choose between the woman he really loves, and the woman he is not really in love with, but he is afraid to lose.",1

"A love triangle is an obvious one, but it can be more complex. What if it's a love square, or a love pentagon? What if the lovers are not all mortal, or all lovable, or all handsome or beautiful? How about Tragedy in the form of a betrayal or a deceit? Or a double Tragedy, such as misidentification of the beloved? What if it's a Tragedy of the Threefold Commandment, the lovers being unable to love God, themselves, or each other?
Write a story about lovers with a ""Retrospective"" plot: This is a plot that begins in the middle of a story or action, then flashes back to explain what happened. The flashback is not just a gratuitous backstory, but is crucial to the telling of the story. It's often used to introduce a character or a situation, as in the movie The Usual Suspects, where the flashback is wisely placed at the beginning of the movie, then we flash forward to see the results of the flashback.
