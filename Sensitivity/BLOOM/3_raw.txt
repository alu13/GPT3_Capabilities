Write a story about lovers with indirect characterization: the plot is driven by the external world, but the characters’ thoughts and emotions are conveyed through their actions and dialog. –> I would never have thought of that (yet another reason why I love this book). And, yes, I decided to write a story about a couple.
If you were writing a novel about a character who is obsessed with the past, what might be the most important scene in the book? –> I am trying to figure it out.
If you were creating an old-fashioned book club, what would be the name of your book club? What would be the name of the book you’d choose for that month? –> I don’t really know. I don’t have a book club any more, but my book club name was “Book Club Girl.” And the book we read? I can’t remember, but I’m sure I would have loved it.

Write a story about lovers with indirect characterization:
- The lovers are you and your boyfriend

This is my story:
I am a boy who is very simple, I am not very smart and I am not very handsome. I usually wear a black T-shirt and a pair of jeans, I like wearing a black cap as well. And I am a very lazy boy who always stays at home. I do not like going out because I am afraid I would get hurt. I am not very good in sports. I am left handed too. My favorite color is black and I like listening to songs. I am a very soft-hearted boy but I am very stubborn and I do not like losing. I do not like to be the center of attention too.
As for my boyfriend, he is tall and handsome, he has long hair. He is very good at playing basketball. He is left handed too. He is very good at sports. And he is not too handsome, he is cute but not too cute.

Write a story about lovers with indirect characterization: Choose a character from one of the stories you read and write a short story about this character. You can choose who you are writing about, how you are writing about them, and what you are writing about them. The only rule is that you must use indirect characterization. Read the rules for indirect characterization below. Examples of indirect characterization are in the lesson on characterization.
Read the following and study the examples. Indirect characterization is the way we talk about a person. When we describe a person, we are not talking about that person, but about how we feel about that person, what we think about that person, or what we want that person to be like. We have to imagine the person we are talking about and then write down how we feel about that person. We have to use what we know about the person we are talking about, but we have to tell a story about that person.
