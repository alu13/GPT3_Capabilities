Picking A) or C) feels boring, but B) is perfect.
Sadly, I don't know how to write historical fiction. I don't know how different it is to write fiction set in the present day. I want to do this right, and I am not sure if it is possible to do this right.
Do I have to pick a historical time period? Can I write about the present? If I pick a time period, what is it going to be? (I am thinking of writing this book in a historical English city, but I am not sure if it is relevant. I think it would be appropriate, but I don't really know.)

As a result, student loan debt has become a major concern for many families. In fact, about 44 percent of recent college graduates are saddled with debt from student loans, and about 12 percent of Americans have more than $100,000 in student loan debt, according to the Federal Reserve.
While student loan debt doesn’t have the stigma that credit card debt or mortgage debt do, it is still important to pay it off as quickly as possible.
Getting ahead of your student loans as quickly as possible may help you avoid the associated debt obligations. This",0
