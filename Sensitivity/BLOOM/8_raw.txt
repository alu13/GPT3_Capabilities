Write a paragraph with ten sentences about love: what it is, what it means to you, and how it changes you. Think about love as a noun, as a verb, and as a state of mind.”
I’ve always thought of love as a verb, as an action. But I know for sure now what it’s like to feel it as an emotion. And I know for sure now what it means to love someone. My husband, my best friend, is the one who made all of this possible. He has loved me in ways I never imagined. He has shown me unconditional love and acceptance, and I could never have imagined how it could look. He has given me strength when I was weak, and dignity when I felt lost. He has been there for me, day and night, all my life. And he will always be there. He is the only person who truly understands me, and he has shown me that love is the most powerful of all things. He has said that I am the most beautiful person he has ever met, and he has shown me that love is the most beautiful thing that exists. I have been loved by him, and it has changed me. Love is the most powerful force in the universe, and I will never forget what

The main body – you have to say something new about the topic, so you should not just repeat what you already said.
The conclusion – it can be a little repetition of the topic, or it can be a few sentences about the topic.

Write a paragraph with ten sentences about love: What it means to you. Please give examples. No dictionary words. Use correct grammar. And if you find it difficult, send it to me and I'll do it for you. No plagiarism.The main observation is a misunderstanding of the role that government plays in society. During the recent financial crisis, governments shovelled money into the banking system without questioning bank behaviour. The result was a massive increase in government debt. In the UK, for example, the public sector net debt has risen from a little over 50% of GDP in 2007, to over 90% in 2019. This is not sustainable, and the governments are now having to repay this debt, while also trying to help the economy revive.
The economic system also needs to change. The current system is based on the extraction of wealth from the bottom 99% of society to enrich a small elite. This system of capitalism is not sustainable and requires a fundamental shift to one that is more equitable and just. This is not an easy task, but it is one that needs to be addressed. The current economic system is unsustainable.
