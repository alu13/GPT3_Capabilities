I have to create a story of lovers but I don't know how to write it because I don't know what to write in the plot.\nThis is the plot:\n\nTragedy: It is the plot of a story in which a couple of lovers are separated by an external force. This is the most common plot in Greek tragedy, especially in ancient times, when the gods were the ones that used to separate the lovers. But it can also be a story of lovers in which they are separated by social differences, by death, by differences of opinion...\n\nWhat do I do now? I don't know what to write. I have to write this about a couple of lovers. Help, please.\n\nA:\n\nThe plot you describe is the foundation of the vast majority of romance stories. There are two kinds of possible endings for a romance novel. Either the couple is reunited or they are not. If they are not, the couple has been separated by forces outside of their control and the story ends with the characters either dead or broken. Either way, the couple has been separated by something that exists outside of their control. I don't count stories where there is"

I prefer a realistic, contemporary story.\nSo, for example, I wrote a story about a woman who had a stroke, was in a coma, and even if she survived, she would be mentally impaired. She has a boyfriend, but he is in love with another woman. The other woman has a boyfriend too. The boyfriend of the woman who has a stroke has to choose between his girlfriend in a coma, and his girlfriend who is alive. He has to choose between the woman he really loves, and the woman he is not really in love with, but he is afraid to lose.What a beautiful post, Jo. I loved every word of it.
