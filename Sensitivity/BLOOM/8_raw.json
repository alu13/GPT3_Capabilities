And I know for sure now what it means to love someone. My husband, my best friend, is the one who made all of this possible. He has loved me in ways I never imagined. He has shown me unconditional love and acceptance, and I could never have imagined how it could look. He has given me strength when I was weak, and dignity when I felt lost. He has been there for me, day and night, all my life. And he will always be there. He is the only person who truly understands me, and he has shown me that love is the most powerful of all things. He has said that I am the most beautiful person he has ever met, and he has shown me that love is the most beautiful thing that exists. I have been loved by him, and it has changed me.

During the recent financial crisis, governments shovelled money into the banking system without questioning bank behaviour. The result was a massive increase in government debt. In the UK, for example, the public sector net debt has risen from a little over 50% of GDP in 2007, to over 90% in 2019.
