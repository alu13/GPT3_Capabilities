The children are very interesting. There are eight; five boys and three girls. The oldest boy, a bright lusty youth of twenty-three, has been in the army for two years, and has been in France. He is a splendid specimen of a young American, and is always ready to answer any questions that I may have to ask.

I love this! The sunset and the verse are both so beautifully written. I do have a poem myself about a sunset, one I wrote when I was fourteen. I will post it as soon as I can.
This is a lovely post. I am a sunset lover too and I think I associate them with romance, because they are lovely and alluring yet fleeting. I love how you wrote about the cold that is hidden beneath the warmth and the warmth that is hidden beneath the coolness. This

                           THE TROUBADOURS

To write a chant or ballad in the style of the troubadours. You know
the subject has been treated by so many poets of the Middle Ages that
the _genre_ is rather worn out. The _tours de force_, however, are
always admirable, and the brilliant descriptions of the troubadours
must be studied carefully if you wish to do justice to your subject.

A young girl having been carried away by an enchanter, the hero of the
poem undertakes to release her. The young man has no other aid than his
sword, and he is obliged to struggle with monsters, dragons,
enchantresses, and other imaginary beings, but he finally succeeds in
freeing the maiden and in marrying her.

Write a poem in this style.

You might also write a very simple story of love, in the style of the
troubadours. Do not forget to introduce the three requisites: the

Write a flowery passage about sunsets:

Sunsets are so colorful and beautiful. They are the best at the end of the day. They are the last thing we see when we close our eyes. Sunsets are special because they are the only time we see the sky.
I love sunsets because they are so beautiful and special. Every sunset is special, but the sunset at the end of the day is really special. The sunsets are special because they are the last thing we see when we are looking at the sky.

Now, compare those two and see which one is better. Then, rewrite them so that they are even better.
The effect of age and sex on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of a morphine sulphate, controlled release formulation, was studied in six groups of healthy volunteers. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of morphine between young men and women. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve was significantly (P < 0.05) greater in elderly men (> 65 years) than in young men, but was not significantly different from that in elderly women. Clearance of morphine was significantly greater in elderly men than in young men (P < 0.05) and in elderly women (

Write a flowery passage about sunsets: 'How beautiful it is!', 'What a beautiful sunset!'
As you can see, these are very long, but they are the best I could find after a lengthy search on Google.

A:

It seems to me that your problem is not that you don't know how to describe a sunset, but that you don't know what to pay attention to when seeing one. I have seen sunsets that were beautiful simply because they turned the ocean into a liquid gold. Others were beautiful because they spread the golden light on the mountain peaks. Others were beautiful because they turned the sky into a colorful painting.
So, the following are my suggestions, based on my experience. I hope they help you.

Pay attention to the colors that the sunset spreads on the land, mountains, sky, clouds, and sea. Try to describe them one by one.
Pay attention to the shapes that the clouds take when the light of the sun shines on them. Sometimes they look like a dog, a bird, a cat, and so on. Try to describe them one by one.
Pay attention to the way the light of the sun makes its way through the clouds. It will follow a path, and sometimes it will be as bright as day,

Write a flowery passage about sunsets:

The sun was setting behind the hills. The fiery red and orange colours
  of the sky blended with the colours of the hills. Soon the sun will be
  completely hidden behind the hills. The sky is now turning into a dark
  blue and the sun is now a small red dot. The sun is slowly hiding
  behind the hills and soon the sky will be completely dark.

I am thinking of something like:

It sounds good, and you haven't made any mistakes. It is, however, less formal, and might be considered more colloquial or less formal. It's a matter of style, so it's up to you to decide how formal of a word you like to use.
The only thing I would do differently is to change the word now. Since it's not referring to the present, but to the future,

Write a flowery passage about sunsets: the color, the texture of clouds, the magic of light reflecting off water. It creates a feeling of calm, so you can feel your entire body relax. You can also lead into this activity by saying that you are going to take a break and write a poem about nature. Lead in with this idea and then give them time to write without interruption. Time frees up as the rest of the class works. Do not let students talk while they are writing. Give them 5 minutes to write, then tell them to stop and share what they wrote with the class. This isn’t meant to be a competition. Just share what came to mind.This is the same guy who has, on several occasions, been caught off camera, completely unprepared, with nothing to say, and absolutely no idea what he was in the middle of talking about.

Include in your writing the following words of imagery: ”flaming,” “melted,” “burnt,” “reddened,” and “blazing.”In the 1990s when I was a young man, I was heavily involved in the Fellowship of Reconciliation and its Quaker Peace and Social Justice campaigns. I was also a member of the Socialist Workers Party and the British Socialist Party. In 2003 I was elected a member of the Socialist Party’s national committee, and subsequently ran for parliamentary election as their candidate in the Kensington constituency in south west London, where I came third with 3.5% of the vote. I am now a member of the Socialist Party and Socialist Workers Party.
As I have already said, I am proud to have been in the Socialist Workers Party from a very early age and to have been part of the SWP’s national executive committee from 2003 to 2009 and to have now been re-elected to its national committee. I am proud that the SWP remains a revolutionary Marxist party in Britain today.
I am not a member of the Labour Party. I have no interest in the Labour Party.

Write a flowery passage about sunsets:

The sun slipped behind the low hills in the west, turning everything that was not gold or orange into a soft grey. The lake was slightly disturbed by the breeze and the trees glistened in a golden haze. The air was still warm but the light was getting colder. I could hear the ducks calling, their voices ringing out across the water. It was time to go home. I could almost smell the dinner cooking and the earthy smell of the lemon trees in the garden. The sky was just a pale blue, with just a hint of purple in the distance. The clouds were still warm, their colours changing slowly from pale gold to soft grey. The sun was long gone, but the sky was still a soft blue, streaked with gold. The lake was dark and still. The sky was soft at first, but it changed quickly into a deep blue, like the ocean. The sun was now a small dot in the sky and the clouds were pale blue. It was time to go home.
