Write a sentence with twenty words about love: It was a sad love story because the boy and the girl died.”
The objective of the game is the same as the previous one: to write a sentence with twenty words. However, this time, the words are the letters of the word “love”, so it takes more time to write the sentence, since it is harder to find twenty words whose first letter is the same. This makes the game suitable for more advanced levels.To do this, you’ll need to get in touch with your local council to find out the tree preservation orders that are in place in your area.
If you can’t find out how to get a tree cut down in your area, or the tree is in a protected area, you’ll need to find a qualified tree surgeon to carry out the work for you.
After all, you don’t want to risk a tree falling on your home or property, which could be costly to repair if damaged.
If you’re looking to hire a tree surgeon, give us a call today on PI:KEY or complete our online contact form and we’ll be in touch as soon as possible with a free quote.
