Write a flowery passage about sunsets:

As the sun sets, the sky takes on a new hue, one that is often described as lavender or pink. The colors are created by the different types of light that reach the ground. The red and orange light that is visible to the human eye is called the visible spectrum. The other part of the light spectrum that is seen is called the ultraviolet spectrum. Ultraviolet light is responsible for creating the colors we see in the sky during a sunset.

Write a flowery passage about sunsets:

The sun dips below the horizon,
leaving the sky in a deep,
orange hue.
The sky is so vast and blue,
it's hard to believe that
just a few hours ago,
the sun was shining.
The stars peek out,
bright and twinkling,
and the moon rises,
a pale, silver light.
It's a beautiful sight,
and it's only going to get better.
