Write a story about lovers with indirect characterization:

Once upon a time there were two lovers who loved each other very much, but they could not directly say how they felt to one another. They would communicate through indirect means, such as writing each other love poems or sending each other heart-felt messages. Even though they were not able to say how they felt directly to each other, they knew that they loved each other deeply and that their love was true.

In the early days of their relationship, they would always make time for each other. They would go on walks and talk, sharing their thoughts and feelings. But as the years went on, they began to lose touch. The years had a way of taking their toll on both of them.

One day, they decided to take a walk again. They walked for hours, talking and catching up on everything. It was wonderful to finally be able to talk to each other the way they used to.

As they were walking, they got lost in their conversation. They didn't notice the path they were on was getting narrower and narrower. They were too wrapped up in what they were saying to each other.

Suddenly, they were in a very dangerous part of the forest. They had no choice but to turn back. As they were turning, they saw a large animal blocking the only way out.

They started to scream, but it was too late. The animal had already caught them.

The two lovers spent their days and nights together, but they never spoke directly to one another. They communicated through notes and letters, and even through paintings and sculptures. Through their art, they shared not only their emotions, but also their deepest secrets.

The lovers were always careful never to say anything that would upset or betray the other, but over time they began to grow tired of always being indirect. They wanted to be able to tell each other everything, and so they decided to take their relationship to the next level.

They moved in together, and they began to openly communicate with one another. They talked about their dreams and their fears, and they confided in one another about everything.

The relationship between the lovers was not always easy, but it was infinitely more fulfilling than their previous relationship. They were able to love one another deeply and completely, and they knew that no matter what happened, they would always be able to count on one another.

The sun was setting and the couple were sitting on the edge of the cliff, watching the sun disappear behind the mountains. They had been there for hours, and the only sound was the wind and the waves.

"I love you," the man said.

"I love you too," the woman replied.

They sat in silence for a while, taking in the beauty of the setting sun.

"Do you want to go home?" the woman said after a while.

"I don't want to go home," the man said. "I want to stay here with you."

"Okay," the woman said, getting up. "Let's go home."

They walked back to the house, hand in hand, and they didn't say a word to each other the whole way.

The two lovers sat on the balcony, looking out at the city. They had been dating for two years, and they were happier than they had ever been.

"I love you," the man said.

"I love you too," the woman replied.

But even though they said the words all the time, the man couldn't help but feel that there was something missing. He wasn't sure what it was, but he just couldn't get that same sense of happiness from being with the woman that he got from being with other women.

He couldn't put his finger on it, but he knew that there was something wrong. He was sure that the woman felt the same way, but she never said anything.

The man tried to talk to her about it, but she always changed the subject. He was starting to feel like she was avoiding him.

One day, the man decided that enough was enough. He decided to break up with the woman.

He was sad, but he knew that it was for the best.
