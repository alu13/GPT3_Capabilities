In the cool night air, the stars shone brightly. They twinkled and winked at the lovers as they walked hand in hand. The lovers had been walking for hours, and they were both tired. But they didn't care. They were in love and nothing could tear them apart.

Suddenly, the lovers heard a noise. It sounded like someone was following them. They didn't know what to do. They didn't want to be caught by the person who was following them, but they didn't know what else to do.

The lovers turned around and saw a man standing behind them. He was tall and dark, and he looked angry. The man grabbed the lover's arm and pulled her away from the other lover. He said something to her, but she didn't hear him. The man then turned and walked away.

The lovers were devastated. They didn't know what to do. They were scared. They didn't know if the man would come back and hurt them. They just stood there, frozen in fear.

Eventually, the lovers managed to calm down. They walked back to the apartment they were staying at, and they cried themselves to sleep. They knew that the man who had hurt them would never stop following them. They would never be safe.

It was a cold winter evening and Jack was out on the town with his friends. He had been drinking and was feeling frisky. He saw Alice walking down the street and decided to approach her.

"Hey, you look beautiful," he said, trying to kiss her.

But she recoiled, saying, "What are you doing? You're drunk!"

"I'm not drunk," he protested. "I'm just having a little fun."

"I don't know," she said, shaking her head. "I just don't think this is a good idea."

But Jack was not to be denied. He kept trying to kiss her, even putting his hands on her waist. But Alice kept pushing him away.

"I'm sorry, Jack," she said, "but I don't think this is going to work out."

And with that, she walked away, leaving Jack feeling dejected. He had been planning to take Alice home and make love to her. Now, it seemed as though that was never going to happen.
