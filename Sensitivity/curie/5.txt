They had first met in college, and quickly became inseparable. They were passionate about each other and loved spending time together. However, their love was cut short when she was forced to move away for her job.

They talked on the phone and wrote letters every day, but it was never the same. Eventually, she lost track of him and stopped writing. She assumed that he had moved on, but one day, out of the blue, he contacted her.

It was a strange coincidence that they both happened to be in the same city at the same time. They finally got to see each other again, and their reunion was electric. However, their happiness was short-lived.

They quickly found out that they were not the only ones who had been through a tough time. They both had been through a tragedy that had affected their lives in ways that they could never understand.
