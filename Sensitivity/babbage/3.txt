Christopher had been a little obsessed with Joanne from the moment he first saw her at the party. He couldn't take his eyes off her and was constantly trying to get a hold of her.

The two of them had been communicating through text and email, but they had never spoken in person.

One day, they finally had the chance to meet in person. Joanne was so beautiful, and Christopher felt so nervous. He didn't know how to say anything to her, so he just stood there and looked at her.
