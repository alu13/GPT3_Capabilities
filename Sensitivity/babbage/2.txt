Love is a beautiful thing, but it can also be a terrifying thing. It can make us feel all warm and fuzzy inside, and then the next day we can't get the image of that person out of our head. It can make us feel like we're in love for the first time, and then the next day they may not even be around. Love can be so incredibly powerful and so incredibly confusing.

Love doesn't always make sense. It's like a puzzle, and sometimes you can't figure out what it's meant to do. Sometimes it's all over before you know it. You've been hurt, and you've been confused, and you've been hurt again. But you can't stop looking for it, and you can't stop wondering what it could mean for you. You have to keep on trying, because it might not be there when you finally find it.
