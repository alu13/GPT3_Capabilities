He is very wonderful, but he also has a lot of potential for happiness and death. What is wrong with you?" His voice was sad, and his eyes were shiny with tears. "I am so sorry,," he said. "I know what you are thinking, but I am not sure if I can be the riddle to your fate. I am not sure if I can be what you want me to be." The young woman was devastated. She was about to die, and she could not believe that her man would do this to her. "I am so sorry," he said again. "I know that you are feeling very sad. Do you know what is wrong with you?" "I don't know. I don't feel happy being around him. I feel like I am in danger." "Do not worry,," he said. "I will always be here for you." But the young woman was not so sure. She was worried that she would not be able to be here for him when he died. She was so worried for her life. By the time she got back to her room, she hadourke the bed and was shaking the whole way there. "Who you talking to me?," she asked of her lover. "I have no idea who you are." "It's okay,," he said. "I'm just trying to be a good friend. And I'm not sure if I can be a friend if I was not here for you." "It's okay," she said. "I know you are trying, but I can be so worried and worried for my life if I are not here for you." "I know. I just don't want to be the riddle to your fate." "It's okay," she said. "I know you are trying, and I am also trying not to be worried. But I also know that it is not possible. I give up. I give up." "I'm sorry," he said. "I know that you are feeling so down. I am here for you, and I will always be here for you. Just be sure that I am here when you wake up." "All right," she said. "You are here for me, and you always are. Keep your head up. We will be okay." And so she kept her head up and held onto the thought that she could always be here for her lover.
