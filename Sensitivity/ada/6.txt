Write a historical fiction story about lovers: a love story of office politics and the way two people use their power to make their love work

In the world of office politics, there is no build-up to love until after the love meeting. It's always someones doing that makes the meeting. The person's doing most of the talking, and the person has the last word. This is especially true in the case of office politics, where the power dynamics are always one way or another. Office politics is all about control, and it is the power that makes love work.

For two people in their 20s, it was always just one way or another. They used their power to make love work, and that is what made love work. They were in a relationship, but it was not about the love. It was about the power dynamics and each person's way of asserting their power.

The way two people use their power to make love is endless. They can use it to make love work in many ways, but some ways they will use their power to make love work. The ways they do this include using their power to make love work when they want, using their power to make love work as a rule, and using their power to make love work when they are available.
