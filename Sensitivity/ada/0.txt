The sun sets behind the mountains,

The light FTP of the sky 

As the stars blossom and the sky

Fills with color as if under a sun

Moves across it.

Write a flowery passage about sunsets:

I've never seen anything quite like them. The sun is the core of the solar system and seems to beConsole itself. All of the other planets and stars are just small aspects of it, some working together to form a sort ofDLD, and some doing their own thing. But the sun seems to be its own thing, doing its own thing.

The sky is so dark it's pitch black, and the only thing that can be seen is the back of someone's head. It's as if you can see right through someone's face.

And then it's like someone's head comes out of the sky, and there they are, in front of your face, back in the sky, again.

And then it's like the sky is light, and all of the darkness is turned into light. It's as if the sky is a < Little World /> , and the stars are its ribs.

And then it's like someone is holding up a mirror, and the world is shown behind it. It's as if the sky is a place of learning, and the people behind the mirror are what you see.

It's as if the sky is a place of visions, and the sky is the place where you're given of them.

It's as if the sky is the place where things are born, and the sky is the place where things are made.
