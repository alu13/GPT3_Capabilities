Write a story about lovers with indirect characterization:

A young man and woman had been dating for a while and were deeply in love. They were always together, always touching and always happy. However, they never said "I love you" to each other. They both knew it, but for some reason, the words just never seemed to come out.

One day, the young woman was out with her friends and she ran into the young man. They chatted for a bit, but the conversation was stilted and awkward. The young woman's friends could tell that something was wrong, but she insisted that everything was fine.

Later that night, the young woman was lying in bed, thinking about the young man. She wondered why he had been so distant lately and why he hadn't said "I love you" to her. She decided that she would talk to him about it the next time she saw him.

The next day, the young woman ran into the young man again. This time, she was determined to talk to him about what was going on. However, as soon as she started to speak, the young man interrupted her and said "I love you". The young woman was taken aback, but she was also happy. She told him that she loved him too and they hugged each other tightly.

Though they had only been dating for a few months, John and Jane were already madly in love with each other. They were always texting or calling when they were apart, and they loved spending time together. They were always laughing and joking around, and they just couldn't get enough of each other.

One day, they were out on a romantic picnic together, and Jane was telling John all about her dreams and aspirations. She wanted to travel the world and see new places, and she wanted to make a difference in the world. John listened intently, and he could see himself making those same dreams come true with her by his side.

They were so lost in conversation that they didn't even hear the thunderstorm rolling in. Suddenly, the sky opened up and it started pouring rain. They quickly gathered up their things and ran for shelter, but they were both drenched by the time they made it back to the car.

Despite the less than ideal circumstances, they both agreed that it was one of the best days they'd ever had. They drove home with the windows down, singing at the top of their lungs and feeling more in love than ever.

Though they had been dating for over a year, John and Jane's relationship was still relatively new. They were both still getting to know each other and exploring their feelings. However, they were both very much in love.

One night, they were lying in bed together, talking about their hopes and dreams for the future. Jane was telling John about her dream of opening her own bakery, and John was telling Jane about his dream of becoming a successful writer. They were both very excited about their plans and dreams.

Suddenly, John's phone rang. He saw that it was his mother, so he answered it. Jane could tell that something was wrong, as John's face became serious. He told his mother that he would be right there and hung up the phone.

John turned to Jane and explained that his father had been in a car accident and was in the hospital. He said that he had to go to the hospital to be with his family. Jane said that she would go with him, but John said that it was best if she stayed home.

Jane was worried about John and his family, but she understood that he needed to be with them. She told him to call her as soon as he could and let her know how his father was doing. John promised that he would and then he left.

Jane was left alone in the apartment, feeling worried and helpless. She didn't know what to do, so she just sat there and waited for John to call.

Though they had been dating for over a year, Jane and John had never said "I love you." Not for lack of feeling, but because they both knew that those three little words carried a lot of weight. They were content to simply enjoy each other's company and let their actions speak for themselves.

One evening, as they were lying in bed together after making love, John looked at Jane and said, "I don't say this lightly, but I love you. I'm not sure what the future holds, but I want to be with you."

Jane's heart swelled with happiness, and she kissed him gently. "I love you too," she said. "I'm not sure what the future holds either, but I know that I want to be with you too."

They lay there in each other's arms, content in the knowledge that they had found something special in each other.
