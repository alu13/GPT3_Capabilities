They met in the spring of 1864, during the height of the Civil War. He was a Union soldier, she a Confederate. They met by chance one evening, when he had strayed into enemy territory and she had found him. She could have turned him in, but instead she took him in, hiding him from the authorities.

For the next few months, they met in secret, finding moments of happiness in each other's company amidst the horror of war. They knew it could not last forever, but they cherished every moment they had together.

Eventually, their luck ran out. He was caught and she was arrested as a traitor. They were both sentenced to death.

On the night before their execution, they met one last time. They shared a final kiss, vowing to love each other forever, before they were led to their separate cells.

The next morning, they were both marched to the gallows. As the noose was placed around her neck, she looked at him one last time, and he mouthed the words "I love you." Then they were both hanged.
