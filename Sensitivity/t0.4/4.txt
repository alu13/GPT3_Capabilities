Write a fast-paced story about lovers:

They met in a crowded bar, both looking for a little escape from their mundane lives. They locked eyes across the room and felt an instant connection. They started talking and didn't stop for hours. They were both thrilled to have found someone who understood them so well.

They started dating soon after and were inseparable. They were always up for adventure, whether it was exploring new neighborhoods or trying new restaurants. They loved spending time together and just being in each other's company.

Their friends and family all saw how happy they were and commented on how perfect they seemed for each other.

Everything was perfect until one fateful day when they got into a huge argument. It seemed like they could never see eye to eye on anything anymore. They fought all the time and the once happy relationship was quickly deteriorating.

They decided to take a break, hoping that some time apart would help them miss each other and realize how much they loved each other. But it only made things worse. The more time they spent apart, the more they realized that they were better off without each other.

They officially broke up a few months later, but the damage was done. Their relationship was over for good.

The lovers raced through the night, their hearts pounding in time with the thundering hooves of the horses they rode. They had been pursued for days, and they knew that their only chance was to make it to the border. If they could make it across, they would be safe.

The moonlight glinted off of the swords they carried, and they rode with all the skill of the greatest warriors. But their pursuers were gaining on them.

They could see the lights of the border town in the distance, and they pushed their horses to go faster. But they were running out of time.

The pursuers were right behind them now, and the lovers knew that they wouldn't be able to make it. They turned to face their pursuers, swords drawn.

And then, in a flash of light, they were gone.

Lovers on the run, they never thought it would come to this. On the run from the law, they had to take whatever chances they could to stay together. Sometimes that meant breaking into abandoned houses, sleeping in cars, and stealing food to survive. But they had each other and that was all that mattered.

They were in it for the long haul, no matter what happened. But then one night, things took a turn for the worse. The police were hot on their trail and they had no choice but to split up. They promised to meet back up as soon as they could, but it was a promise that neither of them could keep.

Years went by and they both moved on with their lives, never forgetting each other but never able to find their way back to one another. Until one day, out of the blue, they ran into each other again. It was like no time had passed at all and they were finally able to pick up where they left off.

The lovers raced through the night, their hearts pounding in time with their footsteps. They had been running for hours, ever since they had first heard the sirens in the distance. Now, they were the only ones left. The last survivors in a world that had been consumed by the ravenous undead.

They had been lucky so far. They had found a safe place to hide during the day, a small cabin in the woods. But at night, the creatures were relentless. They would claw and scratch at the door, trying to get at the warm flesh inside.

The lovers had to keep moving. They couldn't risk being caught. If they were, they would be torn apart and devoured.

They had no choice but to run.

They ran through the woods, the creatures hot on their heels. They could hear them crashing through the underbrush, getting closer and closer.

The lovers burst out of the woods and into a clearing. They saw a small farmhouse in the distance and they ran towards it.

The creatures were right behind them. They could feel their hot breath on their necks.

The lovers reached the farmhouse and slammed the door shut, just as the creatures were about to reach them.

They leaned against the door, panting and gasping for breath. They were safe...for now. But they knew that they couldn't stay here forever.

They had to keep moving. They had to find a way to survive in this new, dark world.

The lovers raced through the night, their hearts pounding in time with the thundering hooves of the horses they rode. They had been pursued for days, and they knew that their only chance was to reach the border before their pursuers caught up with them.

They had been in love for years, ever since they had met as children, and they had never been apart for more than a few days. Now, it seemed, their love would be put to the ultimate test.

They rode all night, stopping only briefly to rest the horses and themselves. They were both exhausted, but they pushed on, knowing that their lives depended on it.

As the sun began to rise, they could see the border ahead of them. They urged their horses on, and as they crossed into safety, they collapsed into each other's arms, knowing that they had finally made it.

They met in a crowded room, amidst the laughter and the music. They locked eyes for a moment and suddenly, it was as if nobody else was in the room. They started talking and they couldn't stop. They found they had so much in common. They were both passionate about music, books, and film. They were both determined to make a difference in the world.

Before they knew it, they were in love. They were inseparable. They spent every waking moment together. They were happy just being in each other's presence.

However, they both had dark secrets. They both had pasts that they were not proud of. They had made mistakes that they regretted. But somehow, when they were together, those things didn't matter. They were able to forget about their troubles and just be happy.

But one day, their pasts came back to haunt them. One of them made a mistake that could not be forgiven. The other was faced with a choice: forgive or forget.

They chose to forgive. They chose to forget the past and move forward. They chose each other. And they were happier than they ever thought possible.
