Write a flowery passage about sunsets:

The setting sun, its warm glow fading in the distance, bathes the hills in a golden light, creating a sea of fire in the sky. The vivid colors, the faint sound of distant voices, the warm air that surrounds me: all of it creates an almost mystical atmosphere. I am reminded of a magnificent painting, where the artist’s brushstrokes transform a landscape into something that seems so much grander than life itself. It is as if I am transported to a time and place far away, with the sunset as my guide.

Write a flowery passage about your kitchen:

Nestled in the heart of our home, the kitchen is a place for a family to share meals, to socialize, and to cook together. Its cabinets are filled with pots and pans of various sizes, each one chosen to fit the needs of the family. We have the big ones for cooking a roast, the medium ones for making a stir-fry, and the tiny ones for making salad (even though we eat a lot of salads). We have the big knives, the medium knives, and the tiny knives (which are actually more like tiny swords). And of course, we have the forks, the spoons, and the knives. They’re all there, in a kitchen that’s filled with warmth, good food, and love.

Write a flowery passage about your car:

My car is my most precious possession. It is a sleek, shiny, and beautiful machine that I have lovingly maintained over the years. It is a symbol of freedom, a measure of my success, and a metaphor for my family: sometimes frustrating, sometimes rewarding, but always there when I need it. It is a constant companion that I have shared many adventures with: road trips through the country, a drive to the beach, and even a spin down a dirt road on a rainy day. It is a car that will be with me for many years to come, and I am proud to call it my own.

Pretend you’re a poet and write a flowery passage about a sunset. Don’t worry about how silly it sounds. Be as flowery and flowery as you can. You’re allowed to use any of the words listed below.

How much did you write?

If you wrote a lot, you’re a natural writer. If you wrote a bit, you’re a “writer-writer.” If you wrote a little, you’re a “writer-er.” If you didn’t write anything, you’re a “not-writer.”

When you write, you have the power to create your own universe that exists only in your mind. Anything can happen in your world. You can have an adventure with a talking apple, rescue a castle from the

Write a flowery passage about sunsets:

You’ve seen the sun set many times before, but have you ever stopped to notice the colors of the sky and the way the sunset looks like fire? Are the colors orange and pink? or are they purple and blue? Are the colors bright and cheerful or dull and lifeless? Is the sunset peaceful, or is it chaotic? Is the sunset beautiful or is it ugly?

This is what I used to learn how to write descriptive paragraphs like this one. I also learned how to write about other things in this same way. For example, I learned how to write a descriptive paragraph about a room in my house.

Are the colors of the walls light or dark? What colors are they? Are the colors bright and cheerful or dull and lifeless? How many windows does the room have? Are the windows large or small? What shape are the windows? Are the windows clean or dirty? How do the windows look? Are the windows shaded or are they open? Are the windows placed high or low? Are the windows open or closed? How full is the room of stuff? Does the room have a lot of stuff in it or is it empty? How old is the stuff in the room? How much is the stuff worth? What are the stuff in the room? Is the stuff old or new? Where in the room is the stuff? Is the stuff dusty or clean? Where did the stuff in the room come from? What is the stuff used for?

This is what I used to learn how to write a descriptive paragraph about a room in my house. I also learned how to write about other things in this same way. For example, I learned how to write a descriptive paragraph about the people I see on the streets.

What do they look like? Are they old or young? Are they smart or dumb? Are they rich or poor? Are they tall or short? Are they fat or thin? Do they wear nice clothes or poor clothes? What color are their clothes? Are they wearing shoes? Are their shoes new or old? Are their shoes worn out or in good shape? Do they have hair? How long is their hair? Are they wearing glasses? Do they have any tattoos?

This is what I used to learn how to write a descriptive paragraph about the people I see on the streets. I also learned how to write about other things in this same way. For example, I learned how to write a descriptive paragraph about my bedroom.

How many windows does the room have? Are the windows large or small? What shape are the windows? Are the windows clean or dirty? How do the windows look? Are the windows shaded or are they open? Are the windows placed high or low? Are the windows open or closed? How full is the room of stuff? Does the room have a lot of stuff in it or is it empty? How old is the stuff in the room? How much is the stuff worth? What are the stuff in the room? Is the stuff old or new? Where in the room is the stuff? Is the stuff dusty or clean? Where did the stuff in the room come from? What is the stuff used for?

This is what I used to learn how to write a descriptive paragraph about my bedroom. I also learned how to write about other things in this same way. For example, I learned how to write a descriptive paragraph about your hairstyle.

How do you style your hair? How do you style your hair? What kind of hair products do you use? What hair products do you use? How often do you wash your hair? How often do you wash your hair? How long does your hair grow in a month? How long does your hair grow in a month?

This is what I used to learn how to write a descriptive paragraph about a hairstyle. I also learned how to write about other things in this same way. For example, I learned how to write a descriptive paragraph about my favorite food.

What is it? What is it? How does it taste? How does it taste? What is the texture of the food? What is the texture of the food? How many calories are in the food? How many calories are in the food?

Write a flowery passage about sunsets:

The sun slowly dipped beneath the horizon like a weary soldier,

leaving a trail of golden rays on the pink clouds.

The sky shimmered,

as if it was made of glass,

and the sun’s rays were rainbow-coloured splashes of paint.

Then the sun disappeared and the sky darkened,

but the clouds were still golden and they glowed in the fading light.

The last of the colours faded,

and night fell over the land.

The sky was a deep blue,

and the stars were twinkling in the sky like diamonds.

The air was warm and the light was soft,

and the grass smelled of roses and jasmines.

The farewell of the sun and the arrival of the night

was a magical moment, and it was the most beautiful sunset ever.

2.1.2.2. Write a scene from a novel:

A woman was lying on the grass. The sun was shining and the sky was very blue. She was wearing a green dress and she was looking at the clouds and the birds. Next to her was a white dog. Suddenly the dog got up, barked and ran away. The woman got up as well, and she saw a black cat. The cat was walking towards her. The woman was scared because she remembered that her mother had told her never to go near a black cat. The black cat was very big and it was dirty. It had long, sharp claws and a red tongue. The cat was walking towards the woman, hissing. The woman ran away, but the cat was very fast. He reached her and scratched her leg. The woman started to cry and she knew that she would have a big scar on her leg for the rest of her life.

2.1.3. Paragraphs

Students often have problems writing paragraphs. This is mostly because of their lack of ability to organise their ideas and their difficulty in expressing their thoughts in writing. It is also because they are not used to writing paragraphs and they do not know how to structure a paragraph.

A paragraph has a topic sentence and supporting sentences. A topic sentence is the main sentence of a paragraph. It states the main idea of the paragraph. It is the sentence that we can use to summarise the paragraph. The topic sentence should be the first sentence of a paragraph. The subject of the topic sentence is a noun or a pronoun, or a noun phrase. It should express the topic of the paragraph. It should be the most important element in the paragraph. The topic sentence should be followed by sentences that give more details about the topic. These sentences are called supporting sentences.

The topic sentence is the most important sentence in the paragraph. It should be clear and concise. It should not start with ‘In this essay’ or ‘I would like to talk about’. It should not be a simple statement. Instead, it should be a topic sentence.

‘The most important sentence in a paragraph is the topic sentence. It should be clear and concise. It should not start with ‘In this essay’ or ‘I would like to talk about’. It should not be a simple statement. Instead, it should be a topic sentence.’

The topic sentence should be followed by sentences that support the topic sentence. These sentences should give more details about the topic. They can be examples, reasons, or contrasts.

The topic sentence and supporting sentences should be in one paragraph. If necessary, the topic sentence can be followed by more supporting sentences to clarify the topic. However, each of these sentences should be in a separate paragraph.

The topic sentence and supporting sentences can be connected by a conjunction. A conjunction is a word such as and or but. A conjunction can also be a phrase such as ‘but on the other hand’.

The topic sentence and supporting sentences can also be connected by a transitional phrase. A transitional phrase is a phrase that links the sentences. It can be a word such as in conclusion or on the other hand, or a phrase such as ‘in conclusion’ or ‘on the other hand’.

The topic sentence and supporting sentences can also be connected by a transitional word. A transitional word is a word such as however or nevertheless.

The topic sentence and supporting sentences can also be connected by a transitional phrase and a transitional word.

A transitional word, phrase or clause should be used to link the topic sentence and supporting sentences. A transitional word, phrase or clause should not be used to start a paragraph.

Paragraphs should be clear and easy to read. They should be written in simple and direct language. They should be connected to each other. They should not be too long. They should not contain long sentences. They should not include too

Write a flowery passage about sunsets:

The sun as it sets

Awe-inspiring

A painful reminder

That the sun will be rising again tomorrow

Bring forth the dawn

Tears of blood

For the sun has set

Forever

I will write the sun a poem

As it sets

And when it rises

I will burn in hell

Because I was too busy writing

And didn't notice

That the sun had set

And I will never see it again

I will never see it

Because I was too busy

Writing

A poem

For the sun

As it set

Forever

And if you think that this poem is bad, then you should see the original. The original was MUCH worse. The above was the result of me making several attempts to fix the original.

The only way that I can fix this is if I throw away the original and start over.

The original had several words that were misspelled on purpose.

The original also had several lines in which I misspelled every single word on purpose.

The original also had several lines in which I misspelled every single word correctly on purpose.

I also misspelled several words correctly on purpose.

I also misspelled several words incorrectly on purpose.

The original was a poem written by a madman.

The original was a poem written by a madman on acid.

The original was a poem written by a madman on acid while on a roller coaster.

The original was a poem written by a madman on acid while on a roller coaster as it went through a car wash.

The original was a poem written by a madman on acid while on a roller coaster as it went through a car wash while performing open heart surgery.

The original was a poem written by a madman on acid while on a roller coaster as it went through a car wash while performing open heart surgery while eating a pie.

The original was a poem written by a madman on acid while on a roller coaster as it went through a car wash while performing open heart surgery while eating a pie while being electrocuted.

I could go on and on, but I don't want to bother.

Basically, the original was a poem written by a madman on acid while on a roller coaster as it went through a car wash while performing open heart surgery while eating a pie while being electrocuted while taking a math test in which he was allowed to use only a calculator that was missing several keys.

And yes, I did try to make this better by taking out some of the misspelled words and replacing them with correctly spelled words. I left the misspelled words in there to show how bad the original was.

This is the original. It was originally written as a poem, but I have since changed it to prose. The original was written in my free time over the course of a few days. I wasn't too concerned about quality. I was just trying to get a feel for a new style of writing.

The above poem was the result of me trying to fix the original.

Yeah. The above poem was the result of me trying to fix the original.

I was going to fix the original, but I decided to make it a little better by changing it into a prose instead of a poem.

The original was written by a madman on acid while on a roller coaster as it went through a car wash while performing open heart surgery while eating a pie while being electrocuted while taking a math test in which he was allowed to use only a calculator that was missing several keys.

So, my original was a little better, but it was still rather bad.

I could have fixed the original by throwing it away and starting over, but I didn't.

I didn't fix the original because I am a masochist.

I didn't fix the original because I am an idiot.

I didn't fix the original because I'm lazy.

I didn't fix the original because I am a manchild.

I didn't fix the original because I am a lazy manchild.

I didn't fix the original because I am a lazy manchild on acid.

I didn't fix the original because I am a lazy manchild on acid while on a roller coaster as it goes through a car wash while performing open heart surgery while eating a pie while being electrocuted while taking a math test in which he is allowed to use only a calculator that is missing several keys.

And, yes, I did try to make this better. It still sucked. The above was the result of me trying to fix the original.

I could have fixed the original by throwing it away and starting over, but I didn't.
