Write a humorous passage about love:

A man with a heart of gold and a woman with a deep

understanding of the value of gold are a match made in heaven.

It is a common belief that gold and gold paint go well

together. When a woman is in love, she puts on her best

dress and her best smile. She goes out of her way to look

good, to appear worthy of the love she feels. She

puts on her best dress, her best jewelry, and her best makeup.

She makes her hair look soft and shiny, her lips look soft

and shiny, and her face look soft and shiny. She wears

her most expensive jewelry, the jewelry that will make

her look good and valuable. She puts on her expression

of love, her smile, her most beautiful and expensive

jewelry. She puts on her love, her wonderful

smile, and her beautiful, expensive jewelry.

What is the moral of this story?

Gold love is best.

When a man is in love, he puts on his best smile and

his best mood. He goes out of his way to look good,

to appear worthy of the love he feels. He puts on his

best mood, his best smile, and his best heart. He

puts on his heart of gold and his best mood. He puts

on his expression of love, his smile, and his best

heart. He puts on his love, his wonderful smile, and his

best heart.

What is the moral of this story?

Gold love is best.

What’s the difference between the man and the woman?

The woman puts on her best and most valuable jewelry

and the man puts on his best and most valuable smile.

Love is a great thing. If you find/feel love, that is. It's like a drug. You get hooked, and want more of it. If you don't have it, you are high. If you do, you are in heaven.

the difference between love and lust?

I think it is very hard to figure out the difference between love and lust. Maybe that's because I don't know what love is. Wait, I do know what love is. Love is great. It's the best feeling in the world. It's like a drug. You become addicted to it. If you don't have it, you are high. If you do, you are in heaven. Lust, on the other hand, is not a good feeling. It's a dirty feeling. It's the feeling you have when you want to do it with a person, but you don't know the person. There are many different kinds of love. First there is the love your family has for you. They will always be there for you. They will love you, even if you don't love them. Next there is the love you have for your friends. They will always be there for you. They are like family. They will never leave you. There is also the love you have for your significant other. They will always be there for you. They are your lover, best friend, and family all in one. There is also the love you have for your friends. They will always be there for you. They are like family. They will never leave you.

Write a humorous passage about love:



At the end of the day, I felt so lonely, so I went to the dog park. I wasn't looking for a companion. I just wanted to find a guy who looked like he had a good job and could pay for my dog's medicine. I thought maybe I would go for a guy who rode a Harley. I asked a guy on a Harley about the dog. I saw a guy who looked like a rube. I went for the guy who looked like a rube. I asked the guy who looked like a rube to buy my dog's medicine. He said he had a better idea. I said, "What's that?" He said, "Let's get married!" I thought I was going to be able to get the dog's medicine.



I was really happy. He was really happy. We were really happy. We really were.



When we got home that night, we were so happy that we made love. The dog barked.



The dog was so happy that he howled, "Bark! Bark! Bark!" all night long. The neighbors were so happy that they called the police. The police were so happy that they came to our apartment. The police were so happy that they arrested us for disturbing the peace.



The judge was so happy that he sentenced us to a year in prison. I was so happy that I said, "Wait a minute, your honor. Don't we get to say something?" The judge said, "No. I'm happy." The judge was so happy that he made me marry the guy. I was so happy that I said, "Wait a minute, your honor. I don't want to marry this guy." The judge said, "You have to marry this guy, or you'll go to jail for a year." I was so happy that I said to the judge, "I quit." The judge was so happy that he said, "That's it! I'm sentencing you to five years in prison!"



I thought I was so happy, but I was so confused. I was so confused that I thought I was happy.



My friend told me that I had to choose between the guy who looked like a rube, and the guy who rode a Harley. I couldn't choose between them. I was too happy.



My dog was so happy that he ran away.



I was so happy that I went to the dog park.



I was so happy that I didn't notice I was standing in the middle of a lake.

THE MIKE STERN PRINCIPLE


Mike Stern is a jazz guitarist. I’ve seen him perform several times. He has a band. He’s really good. His band is really good. They do everything together. They think together. They listen together. When the time is right, they play. It’s more than just a band, it’s a way of life. It’s a way of thinking. It’s a way of listening.

Mike is not only an accomplished musician, he’s a walking guitar encyclopedia. He knows what makes a guitar, a guitar. He knows the history of the guitar and the different kinds of guitars. He knows the greats of the guitar, he knows what they play, he knows why they play it, he knows how they play it, he knows how they think. He knows all this by listening.

“All you have to do is listen,” he says. “Don’t think, don’t talk, just listen.”

It’s a principle he practices, and teaches.
